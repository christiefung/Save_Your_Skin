5,5,B07RK4HST7,CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion | 19 Ounce | Face & Body Lotion for Dry Skin with Hyaluronic Acid | Fragrance Free,"Just want to let everyone know that the cerave lotion on the left is one I bought from cvs, and the one on the right is the large one from amazon, and you can clearly see that they put hyaluronic acid lower on the list for the amazon one, vs the cvs one. And just in case you don't know, ingredients for any products go in order from the greatest amounts first, and descend to lower amounts as you go down the list. The cvs one has hyaluronic acid much higher on the list, and the packaging looks completely different too! Like, why?? Does cerave make a cheaper version of their products for amazon, vs other retailers?? And that is just really annoying, aggravating, and upsetting to me. Why water it down to buy it for a cheaper price? No one wants that. Everyone wants to get what they pay for. For sure, the one from cvs was much pricier ($17) for the smaller bottle size, while the amazon one was like, $12 when I got it for the large, 19 oz one. But I just want to say that I KNOW what I'm paying for!! If its a cheaper price for a more watered down product, I'm not going to get it!! Just leave the products the way that they are. And I have to say that yes, the textures between them were NOTICEABLY different! The one from cvs was definitely more opaque and creamier, while as soon as I got the amazon one, I immediately immediately noticed, without a doubt, a more watery consistency. Um, barf. Never going to buy this product from amazon again because of how they're so blatantly cheating! I'll just put my money in something else",2.0 out of 5 stars,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71jPQctKGsL.jpg,dry,dry_B07RK4HST7_pid5_0,https://www.amazon.com/CeraVe-Moisturizing-Lotion-Hyaluronic-Fragrance/dp/B07RK4HST7/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=B07RK4HST7&qid=1592563721&sr=8-1,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51YT4dO6bfL._SL1000_.jpg
6,6,B07RK4HST7,CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion | 19 Ounce | Face & Body Lotion for Dry Skin with Hyaluronic Acid | Fragrance Free,"Before i get into my novel of a review, here’s the summary of what i think. I came across this while looking for a lotion that works best for Non-oily skin, a daily lotion, for sensitive-ish skin, i found the PERFECT one with this.I bought this about 2 weeks ago, was shipped in 2 days, & when i received it nothing was wrong with the packaging or bottle. Anyways, I started using this after i decided to switch from my Neutrogena Oil-Free Moisture which i had been using for about 6 months. I do not have naturally Oily Skin so it was too drying. But with maaaaany hours spent looking for a FACE lotion with good reviews I came across this and let me just say IT IS WORTH THE MONEY, I am in love! works for face and body which i was skeptical about at first but i do not regret my purchase at all and i highly highly reccomend anyone purchase this.

Over the years I’ve gone through a number of lotions, searching for one that keeps my skin hydrated without any side effects (breakouts, rashes, etc). I’ve been using this daily moisturizer for a few weeks now and it’s worked out very well so far. I only have to apply once in the morning and my skin feels moisturized throughout the day. I guess that’s the hyaluronic acid doing it’s job.This lotion is lightweight and doesn’t leave me feeling greasy. It also doesn’t have much of a scent which I count as a plus. Best of all my skin isn’t breaking out or changing in any negative way.Although this product is touted as face and body lotion I have yet to use it on my face.

10,10,B07RK4HST7,CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion | 19 Ounce | Face & Body Lotion for Dry Skin with Hyaluronic Acid | Fragrance Free,This is my absolute favorite moisturizer. It helps so much with dry patches during the winter time and even during the summer time it doesn't clog my pores or make you break out. It's such a great value I end up buying this versus the a.m. and p.m. because it's such a good value for the side and the money. I use this year round on my chest neck and face and I don't have any breakouts from it. I also love this because it's so easy to get and hardly ever out of stock.

37,37,B00352MHE2,"Cetaphil Daily Advance Ultra Hydrating Lotion With Shea Butter For Dry, Sensitive Skin, 16 Fl Oz (Pack of 1)","A good, heavier body moisturizer. Cetaphil's current packaging shows it is the ""middle"" of their lineup.Here in the mid-Atlantic (with our humid summers), I use it mostly during winter cold snaps, and use Cetaphil's lighter ""All Skin Types"" most of the time. Those of you living in dry climates might find it useful year around. The ingredient list is similar to that lighter lotion, but swaps the avocado oil for macadamia nut oil, and adds shea butter.The lotion is moderately heavy, you can feel it on your skin (likely the shea butter), and if you wash your hands too soon, you'll notice the slickness. I'm not a fan of this weight of lotion normally since it gets on things, and I don't want to pet my cats with it on my hands. But if you're suffering from dry skin or chapping, this is the way to go. And it's not particularly heavy or greasy compared to other heavier lotions I've tried.The odorless is worth extra praise. Manufacturers today seem to fill most products with cloying, overwhelming scents. As a typical male, I'm not really interested in my lotion (or me) smelling like cheap perfume. Worse, many synthetic scent compounds are implicated as health hazards. So an unscented lotion is the only way to go for me. Kudos for Cetaphil doing that across their product line.The packaging changes occasionally (including since last year), but the ingredients seem to stay the same. The current product photo here isn't the new packaging, so I've included a pic of it here.This is my go-to lotion during excessively dry spells.

My rash has been really bad this week, and I am using a lot of this lotion.Instead I got something else as shown in the picture I submitted with this review.

I have noticed a huge difference in my face. It is much softer and moisturized. For best results, put this product on after the shower or after washing your face with water to slow down transepidermal water loss and hydrate your skin.What is great about this product is that it contains hyaluronic acid in the form of sodium hyaluronate. Hyaluronate is a glycosaminoglycan, which means it is a carbohydrate composed of repeating disaccharide units and contains an amino sugar (a sugar with a nitrogen). Hyaluronic acid is found all over the body in various tissues and serves as an important part of lubrication for tissues. In the skin, it is involved in tissue repair. Along with ceramides, which belong to the lipid family, hyaluronate is a great ingredient for hydrating your skin.I am a normal to oily skin type and find that this product is good for me as well. This product and products similar to it are definitely not only for dry skin types (or extra-dry skin types, as the label advertises), they are great for all skin types. For people with normal to oily skin, hydrating your face properly can actually contribute to less oily skin because your face is not producing oil in response to dryness. Keep in mind it is also important to use good sunscreen every day to protect your skin.This product is also great because it is unscented, which is best for skin care. It also non-comedogenic meaning it will not clog pores (good for oily skin types as well). Though the jar appears small, I have found it lasts quite along time,  because you only need a small amount to really hydrate your face. So, use length will really only depend on how many times a day you use it because you do not need much every time. I am totally converted and will continue to use this product or other products containing hyaluronic acid.Feb 10 2020 ***Updated to add***: I still enjoy this product. If you are using this as a moisturizer after getting your face wet (like after the shower or washing your face with water), I also recommend putting on a more occlusive (blocking, sealing) moisturizer on after this one, to seal in the water and hyaluronic good stuff. It depends on what works for your skin type but in the way of occlusive moisturizers I have enjoyed Aveeno's daily with oatmeal (they have several types), CeraVe daily, and LRP Lipikar baume AP+.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61ENLSkDHCL.jpg,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61sj-M0ITLL.jpg",dry,"dry_B00NR1YQK4_pid104_0,dry_B00NR1YQK4_pid104_1",https://www.amazon.com/Neutrogena-Hyaluronic-Hydrating-Moisturizer-Gel-Cream/dp/B00NR1YQK4/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=B00NR1YQK4&qid=1592563980&sr=8-1,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81wNmR0dB8L._SL1500_.jpg

I must have spent hundreds trying to find that one spring to summer skincare product that doesn't make me look like an oil slick, leave a white cast, or break me out. I think this one might just be the holy grail product I've needed. Sometimes you can't trust Allure or other beauty websites because you know they're getting paid to promote it. I can honestly say this is a dupe for Tatcha Water Cream. The -only- issue is that for the price point it does have silicone in it as a ""filler"". I'm not sensitive to it but I am sensitive to mineral oils and heavier creams. So if that is an issue I would be careful before buying. I'm one of those fair skinned gals who seems to break out if I so much as turn my head towards the wind wrong and I haven't had a single breakout with this moisturizer.

Allergies make everything worse, and so does a diet previously based on fast food. Now diabetic, I noticed my skin becoming reddened, dry, rough in spots with flaking. I've used Neutrogena Rainbath gel for it's moisturizing and gentle cleansing, but needed something else for my face.I found this. Absolutely love it. It's not just for what it says it is - the hydrophilic hyaluronic acid that absorbs up to 1000x its weight.It's what it does.It's the way my skin feels after I put it on. I wash, blot but leave a touch of water on my face, then take a little on my finger - let it mix with that residual moisture. All over my face, eyelids (close them tight) and neck.I know I did it right when I get that enjoyable tingle - and an indescribable feeling that my skin feels pleasantly tighter - supple - like it's refreshed and awake. Like it's been given a healing balm.I use it nightly. Within a couple of days the difference was visible. That redness and flaking was gone. My face and neck felt - healthy. Good. I could see and feel the difference.It is a mix of gel and cream. Spreads easily. Absorbs quickly. No mess. No problem.

Luckily it’s seems to be migrating only on my cheeks, and neck!I’ve seen two dermatologists that put me on antibiotics which helped temporarily but after three months the condition came back with a vengeance!

After all of my trial and error I finally stumbled upon two things that really worked for me! 1. Turmeric supplements and 2. Puriya!

At first I thought it was insect bites, but it was not.  The bumps would flatten out at times, but then get intensely itchy again.  When I would scratch, everything got inflamed and bumpy all over again.  This went on for 8 weeks.  I finally received a prescription strength cortisone cream from my dermatologist and tried that for a few weeks, but it made absolutely no difference.  When the cortisone cream did not work, I was very surprised and began to stress out about this ugly itchy rash.  I began googling contact dermatitis/eczema, and I happened to find a reference to this cream.  I was skeptical, but I immediately purchased a jar from Amazon -- I had nothing to lose at this point.  After 2 weeks, the rash almost completely disappeared -- see picture.  I could not believe it.  I kept the jar in my refrigerator as suggested, and every time my arm started to itch, I applied some.  The coolness felt good, but it also tingled a tiny bit and somehow stopped the itching.  Looking at the natural ingredients, I do not understand how the cream works.  I just know that it does.  I waited a few weeks before writing this review.  During that time, the rash healed over, but then started up again in just one small penny-sized area -- again on my right forearm.

Over the past 2 years, I started to develop some type of rashes around my mouth and now along the folds of my nose.

The “rashes” kept getting bigger and bigger. I had to stop using my face moisturizers or anything that had retinol. Face masks were a no because it really burned those areas and make them worse. On some days the area would appear flaky and started to peel. My doctor just gave up on me and didn’t do anything else so I decided to research other creams or causes of what could it possibly be. I found this cream across amazon, and I read someone else’s review which stated she suffered from perioral dermatitis. She provided pictures and the exact same flare ups she had, I had as well. I decided to give it a try and even more because the company has a 180-day get your money back if you’re not satisfied with the product.

My condition is hereditary, (the things we get from our parents aren’t always gifts), and like eczema mine is incurable, the best I can hope for is an itch free, flake free day...One of the best product I use, and there are only a few, is Mother of All Creams. First I love the scent, which, as a rule when dealing with psoriasis, is no perfumes or dyes or alcohol...second the fact that you put it in the refrigerator and it gets cold...nothing more soothing than this on a flaming flare up. Not only does it calm the fire of burning cracking skin, but it helps calm the redness and allows the skin to gently fall off on its own...I know that sounds a bit gross, okay, a lot gross, but the truth in the matter is that if it doesn’t fall off, it will build up and become almost cystic. I don’t think I can say enough on how much this product has helped me, I truly count my lucky stars that someone made it and I found it.If there is one thing that I would change, is that it comes in a bigger tub...I use every last ounce I can, even taking a swab to make sure none goes to waste.Thank you for this wonderful gift and all the precious time, energy and effort you have put into it!Felicia Knigjtstep",5.0 out of 5 stars,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51L1ZbRwfWL.jpg,dry,dry_B00YHZFA5E_pid136_0,https://www.amazon.com/Puriya-Psoriasis-Dermatitis-Powerful-Irritated/dp/B00YHZFA5E/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=B00YHZFA5E&qid=1592564012&sr=8-13,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Lu3oE4oBL._AC_SL1500_.jpg

I was prescribed a $500 cream from my dermatologist. $500!!!! Well I certainly wasn't going to pay that so I did research online and came across this cream. $30 seemed steep for such a small amount but let me tell you...a little goes a LONG way. I literally use a dab and it spreads pretty well so I think it's going to last me a very long time so I don't mind the price.

I bought it as it was very reasonably priced. I normally buy Vaseline body lotion but bought this for a change. It worked great. I was worried about the consistency and texture after reading lot of reviews. I am glad I took the chance. It is very thick in texture and rich in quality. Well nourishing and moisturizing. Gets absorbed in skin really fast. Good for daily use. I had only two concerns ... the scent is good on its own but doesn’t gel with my body scent very well (I am glad it fades off in sometime) It’s little milky kind of scent and other is I agree with other users that bottle in little empty on the top. May be it’s meant to be that quantity  but bottle doesn’t come sealed in a plastic pack so that can be worrisome to few.

222,222,B000YJ2SLG,CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion | 12 Ounce | Face & Body Lotion for Dry Skin with Hyaluronic Acid | Fragrance Free,"Just want to let everyone know that the cerave lotion on the left is one I bought from cvs, and the one on the right is the large one from amazon, and you can clearly see that they put hyaluronic acid lower on the list for the amazon one, vs the cvs one. And just in case you don't know, ingredients for any products go in order from the greatest amounts first, and descend to lower amounts as you go down the list. The cvs one has hyaluronic acid much higher on the list, and the packaging looks completely different too! Like, why?? Does cerave make a cheaper version of their products for amazon, vs other retailers?? And that is just really annoying, aggravating, and upsetting to me. Why water it down to buy it for a cheaper price? No one wants that. Everyone wants to get what they pay for. For sure, the one from cvs was much pricier ($17) for the smaller bottle size, while the amazon one was like, $12 when I got it for the large, 19 oz one. But I just want to say that I KNOW what I'm paying for!! If its a cheaper price for a more watered down product, I'm not going to get it!! Just leave the products the way that they are. And I have to say that yes, the textures between them were NOTICEABLY different! The one from cvs was definitely more opaque and creamier, while as soon as I got the amazon one, I immediately immediately noticed, without a doubt, a more watery consistency. Um, barf.

Anyways, I started using this after i decided to switch from my Neutrogena Oil-Free Moisture which i had been using for about 6 months. I do not have naturally Oily Skin so it was too drying. But with maaaaany hours spent looking for a FACE lotion with good reviews I came across this and let me just say IT IS WORTH THE MONEY, I am in love! works for face and body which i was skeptical about at first but i do not regret my purchase at all and i highly highly reccomend anyone purchase this.

I decided to try something new and go with a premium moisturizer instead of the cheap ones I generally go with. This has proven to be an excellent product. The cheap lotions and moisturizers either lose their moisturizing capabilities fairly quickly, or are very oily. I can't stand the feeling of an oily product on my skin all day! This Manuka Honey Moisturizer has fit the bill for sure. It lasts all day, but does not have an oily texture to it after application. Of course you can feel it on your skin right after application, but it quickly dissipates and just becomes a protective layer. The scent that it has is unique, but I'm sure that's because of all the different moisturizers in it. But I will say, after a few times using it, I don't really even notice it.

BONUS!!My husband just had a rash last week, and decided he wanted to try it. So we went & bought more.IT WORKED FOR HIM TOO!So try it!Also, My advice, for regular bumpy skin, change soaps and use castille soap. I used to have bumps on the back of my arms and they are gone now since I switched to a castille soap.

For her age, Mom's skin has looked healthy, and people have commented how good her overall skin looks. It wasn't until recently that I used this cream on myself and fully realized how good it is. I had contacted poison ivy, and my reaction was exceptionally bad. I broke out in a welted rash and blistered sores that itched like crazy. A Prednisone prescription from the doctor stopped the blistering, but the red welts and patches continued to spread. This spread to both arms, both legs, torso, and my face. Since most itch creams are designed to dry  the oils of poison ivy, my skin all over was flaking and and felt dried an taut.I decided to try this cream for some relief and the results were amazing. I put it on all of the dried areas, and relief was almost immediate. At first, I used it 3 times per day, and within a couple of days the redness started to go away and the dry skin was no longer dry or swollen.After this experience, I will use this after my baths to moisturize my skin. Since it worked so well for the extreme conditions I experienced, I'm sure it would be beneficial in moisturizing my skin as well as my mother's. Since I am now 72 year's old, I should probably take care of my body skin as well as my mother's.I hope this review was helpful for you.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/712a8zkAXnL.jpg,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71g-tn-uqgL.jpg",dry,"dry_B0067H6G26_pid266_0,dry_B0067H6G26_pid266_1",https://www.amazon.com/Aveeno-Emollients-Fragrance-Free-Moisturizing-Extra-Dry/dp/B0067H6G26/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=B0067H6G26&qid=1592564411&sr=8-1,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81hSVOA%2BsGL._SL1500_.jpg

319,319,B01H6OYPU8,NIVEA Cocoa Butter Body Cream 15.5 oz,"First: this is a HUGE jar of cream. So $9.99 (at time of this review) for a great cream - a bargain. Especially a trusted brand like Nivea.What I worried about was that it would be greasy. The last dry skin body cream I ordered in another brand was so greasy, I can't stand to use it. I have to plan when to use that cream because my sheets or clothes will stick to me - hate that! So I did worry this thick-looking Cocoa butter cream would do the same.However, I need not have to worried! Though this cream is super emollient and thick, it soaked into my skin right away. The scent is very soft - not exactly flowery (which I am not a ""flowery"" type woman), but soft, though it stays and stays, the scent does, for many hours--I don't like the scent enough to want it to stick around that long, since it is a little too sweet-scented for my tastes, but if you like the scent you will be really pleased at how long it lingers.And, my skin is so soft I can't stop rubbing my hands together to feel how soft and silky they are (laugh!). I can use this over my entire body at night (or anytime) and not worry about my sheets sticking to me, or during the day and not worry about my clothes sticking to me. I even rubbed a little into my face - this could make a great night cream for wintertime when the air is so very dry.I'm really happy with this - made me smile.Yay! Soft, silky skin without the greasy feel. Nice pleasant scent. Plenty of product to last a long time. What more could I want? Oh!

The customer service person was great. She contacted me when the bottle was delivered and admitted that there was a strong odor to it. They sent me a new bottle of lotion which was fine.Something's changed. I've been buying and using this lotion for six years and have thought it wonderful and miraculous. Then, last winter (2015 January to February) it got all thin and watery. I bought four bottles from three different sources and all of them were watery.  I finally contacted the company who admitted there had been a ""bad batch"" and sent me a new large bottle that was just fine. So I thought things we ok. About a month ago I bought a large bottle here from Amazon and when it arrived there was a small round sticker on the front of the bottle that said ""New thicker formula."" I thought perhaps they put it on to address the previous watery stuff that so many consumers had experienced. When I used the product it was thick enough but had a very bad plastic chemical smell. I checked to see that the bottle was ""unscented"" and it did say so in the labeling.  But what a smell. I used it for three nights but now I just can't bear the awful smell.  I'll be contacting the company again to see what they did to it this time.  How I wish I could just get a bottle of their lotion that is the same as what I used for the first five years!

I am a college student so i'm constantly running around outside from building to building and living in new york it gets pretty cold.For a man such as myself, I've undermined the importance of daily skin care for a long time but recently I've gone further to protect my skin, because why not keep your skin healthy and lively. Whether you think so or not, having healthy skin will improve your daily quality of life. People are sure to notice the difference, and will definitely improve your self esteem. Bright, Soft, Healthy skin is good all year round!.This cream smells amazing!. Me and my mother both use this, and we both love it. just a small dab of it is enough for both my arms, hands and my face. I have definitely felt the difference on my skin after using this the past two weeks. My face feels much softer and looks better. It lasts all day and has become part of my daily routine before leaving the house. The bottle is bigger than i expected so i'm sure it will last me a couple months of use. I will be sure to update this review when it has run out and how my skin is doing after a couple of months.Overall I would definitely recommend this cream to anyone, man or woman, to include in your daily skin care, or even as a gift to a friend.

The smell is faint, but it smells like something my grandmother would use, it does go away after a few minutes though.

With mineral oil as the second ingredient (behind water-which means it's the most  abundant ingredient besides water) anyone with super dry skin will generally have issues staying moisturized. Mineral oil has to tendency to draw moisture from the deeper layers of your skin and hold it in the surface layers. Makes your skin feel wonderful for a short time until the surface starts drying out. Then you need to reapply. Great for the manufacturers as they sell more since your using more.

I have used Eucerin Intensive Repair and it does help, but I really hate the sticky texture and the smell is weird..it's not strong, but enough to repel me. This Curel hydra therapy not only stopped flaking of my leg skin, it also makes my skin feels so smooth. It is a lot lighter compared to the Eucerin Intensive Repair and rubs in very quickly. It is supposed to be applied when skin is still wet, but it takes longer to absorb if applied wet. I usually apply it after towel dry, and it still does the job. It has a very subtle orange smell (from orange peel I believe) which is delightful. I even decanted it into small bottles so I can carry it around to use as a hand cream.

416,416,B01GPWPJOS,"Curel Hydra Therapy Wet Skin Moisturizer for Dry & Extra-Dry Skin, 12 Fl Oz (Pack of 1)","This is good stuff! No heavy scent or thick hard to rub in goopey feel to it.  A lotion created to be put on when your skin is wet, it glides on easily and is absorbed fairly quickly without much of a sticky residue. It can be used on dry skin as well of course, but it really is best used when you are damp out of the shower when your skin's pores are open and ready to accept the lotion.This package contains (4) 12 ounce bottles, making each one around six dollars.  Initially that price seemed a tad spendy to me, until I saw how well it worked.The lotion left my skin feeling smooth and hydrated, and this lasted for several hours post shower. **Pat yourself dry after applying for the best results versus rubbing with a towel.** Certain areas (elbows and knees) appeared drier sooner than other areas, but a reapplication to dry skin took care of that problem. The lotion is very concentrated, so whether using it wet or dry I needed very little to get the desired effect.  I did avoid putting this on my face during the day as it appeared somewhat greasy and wasn't the look I was going for with my mineral based matte make-up.I did use it at night after washing my face in place of my usual nightly moisturizer and it worked well. Wherever it is used it seems to create a moisturizing layer to the skin that acts as a barrier of sorts. I noticed it most on my hands when after applying the lotion hours later washing my hands and having them feel moisturized while washing instead of dry afterwards. Definitely seems to work best with continued use, but even with one application it's noticable.Overall, I think this is an excellent product for the whole family. It's not too greasy or sticky going on, and it is absorbed quickly without being sucked up and forever gone as with some lotions. It left my skin looking healthier (see before and after photo on my hand) and had no icky scent. Definitely recommend it to everyone!",5.0 out of 5 stars,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/7124dRe8TaL.jpg,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71B39e24TnL.jpg,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71fpItuP7BL.jpg,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71seHd1QsmL.jpg,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71vbpMn8s4L.jpg,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81xcCTeQr9L.jpg",dry,"dry_B01GPWPJOS_pid416_0,dry_B01GPWPJOS_pid416_1,dry_B01GPWPJOS_pid416_2,dry_B01GPWPJOS_pid416_3,dry_B01GPWPJOS_pid416_4,dry_B01GPWPJOS_pid416_5",https://www.amazon.com/Cur%C3%83l-Hydra-Therapy-Moisturizer-Extra-Dry/dp/B01GPWPJOS/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=B01GPWPJOS&qid=1592564894&sr=8-11,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71bTQIOhYdL._SL1500_.jpg
417,417,B01GPWPJOS,"Curel Hydra Therapy Wet Skin Moisturizer for Dry & Extra-Dry Skin, 12 Fl Oz (Pack of 1)","I have used other in shower moisturizers, but this here is my first time using Curel hydratherapy. I got a tube as a sample from Crowdtap and so I wanted to give it a try and see how it worked compared to others that I have used. The moisturizer does not really have to much of a smell at all. Actually I do not think it has any smell at all. Even though there is no scent it worked extremely better than I thought, and that is fine with me. I do have really dry skin, so finding a good moisturizer is hard for me. So when I find a good one I try to stick with it! I have eczema so my skin changes with the season so I was really happy when getting a chance to try this out. Curel has some really great products so I just knew that this wet skin moisturizer would be nothing less then the best.I have been using for about a week now  everyday and I have noticed a difference in my skin and the way it feels. Fall is here and well going into winter and my skin changes almost for the worst. It gets very dry sometimes no matter how much moisturizer I use. It really just depends on the day and the heat. I use other great body washes that have kept my skin feeling wonderful after a shower but then I'd have to put on an additional moisturizer. When using this I noticed that it didn't take long to soak into my skin at all. Another major plus is that my  skin did'nt feel all extra sticky once dried which is AMAZING! My skin didn't feel heavy at all afterwards, I really like this and it has marked its spot in my skin care routine!➽➽I RECEIVED THIS CUREL SAMPLE COMPLIMENTARY OF CROWDTAP TO TRY FOR TESTING PURPOSES AT A DISCOUNT, THIS DOES NOT IN ANYWAY AFFECT MY OPINION OF THE PRODUCT, ALL OPINIONS ABOVE ARE THAT OF MY OWN➽➽",5.0 out of 5 stars,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71-dNewVc8L.jpg,dry,dry_B01GPWPJOS_pid417_0,https://www.amazon.com/Cur%C3%83l-Hydra-Therapy-Moisturizer-Extra-Dry/dp/B01GPWPJOS/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=B01GPWPJOS&qid=1592564894&sr=8-12,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71bTQIOhYdL._SL1500_.jpg
418,418,B01GPWPJOS,"Curel Hydra Therapy Wet Skin Moisturizer for Dry & Extra-Dry Skin, 12 Fl Oz (Pack of 1)","Applying lotion on wet skin is something I have done for years although the in-shower lotions, the ones that are to be applied and then rinsed off in the shower have largely left me unimpressed and often with a greasy shower to clean.But this product is simply to be used after showering while skin is still damp. Pat dry with a towel after applying. I found the lotion is quickly absorbed and the water promptly evaporated so there was very limited need to use the towel.A little goes a long way, so only a small amount is needed to adequately moisturize. And another attribute is the lack of detectable fragrance. What a relief not to juggle soap, shampoo and conditioner along with lotion. This also makes the product suitable for either gender.The product did not leave a greasy film or feel. Instead what remained was the impression of a slightly powdery finish and skin that looked noticeably hydrated. I kept a bottle on my desk and reapplied it to my hands periodically and that method was effective, as well.Note that the product has a long list of ingredients and since sensitivities to particular items are not uncommon it might be worth checking the specifics to at least eliminate known problem components.The pump mechanism has a large platform to depress which is more comfortable to use than the skinny spigots, and another user-friendly design, the bottle has ridges on either side to help create a sure-grip when hands are wet.

I have moderate to severe eczema and even tho this isn't the crazy expensive stuff people with my condition are used to it helps cool the burn when I don't have anything. Doesn't help the itching at all tho.2. The scent is really good as well it's texture is completely different if u have tried the raw form they have . That one smells good but lingers way to long lol. This is just right.3. Probably my favorite thing about the Palmer's brand . The fact that it gets rid of scars and tones skin. I have been using this for 6 months and I have before and after pics of u keep a healthy skin and eat clean stuff worksDislikes:1. As u can see in this picture it takes a while for the lotion to actually rub in sometimes leaving some residue if u don't really rub it super well.

The second picture has a lighter inbetween the products for size reference. The smaller container is more for on the go remedies. It could easily be placed in your purse, gym bag, or in the car. The bigger jar would be for more home use. And let me just say it is BIG. You get alot of product for your money which is awesome!The product itself is the best ointment I have ever used for cracked or dry skin! Its on a different level of healing power. Within one use you will feel your skin feeling much better and very moisturized. I use this after I get a new tattoo and the skin starts being coming itchy and flakey (as recommended by my tattoo artist). Its seriously a life saver. Not to mention if my hands are hurting or feeling dry I just put a small amount on and it instantly feels better!The ointment doesnt necessarily have a good smell or a bad smell. It just smells like regular ointment,  and when you do use some you just need a tiny bit. A tiny bit goes along way with this stuff. This should last you a long time!

464,464,B00143UYJE,"Alba Botanica Very Emollient Maximum Body Lotion, 32 oz.","I've loved this lotion (Maximum Dry Skin) for years. At first I loved it without reservation. Then, as many have pointed out, the formula changed. It still worked well in the sense of treating very dry skin, but it was waxier (both in texture and in smell), didn't rub in quite as well, and, most frustratingly, you could only get about 75% of the product out of the bottle. In 2014 I ordered 4 of the big 32 ounce sized bottles and one by one, I got about 75% finished and no more would pump out, like a too-thick milkshake. I even bought some of those bottle coupler things and the lotion sat upside down on top of another quarter-full bottle for weeks and STILL didn't move out of the bottle. Eventually I gave up and threw them away. I have used other lotions since then, but did purchase one of the smaller size when I was desperate. Again, waxy smell and feel, and 75% of the way through, I stopped being able to pump it.Cut to yesterday, it was on sale at Whole Foods so I picked up another quart, expecting to again only get to use three quarters of it, but being ok with that since it really works the best for my dry winter skin. But when I went to put it on after my shower, I was surprised that the texture was much looser (in a good way), and it rubbed in much easier than my previous bottle. I have only used it once, but I believe that this one will pump out all the way. Only giving four stars because I'm annoyed at the continued reformulations, but I'm optimistic that the right stuff is back!Photos showing: 1: new good bottle (left) vs old bad (this is how much product is left when I can no longer get any out), 2: batch codes for good (L) and bad (R) 3: was stabbing around with the straw trying to get some out and the holes just stay there.

466,466,B00143UYJE,"Alba Botanica Very Emollient Maximum Body Lotion, 32 oz.","I was super excited about this lotion and had to order from Amazon because no local stores had this scent. I love coconut scented lotion and decided I’d give Alba a try. FIRST, the scent is HORRIBLE! There’s a tiny (very tiny) hint of coconut coming from the bottle BUT as soon as you rub the lotion on your skin, there’s no trace of coconut smell at all...INSTEAD, it smells like playdough! I’ve neversmelt anything so gross for a lotion. If you’re looking for a nice smell of coconut, do not be fooled. SECONDLY, this lotion is very thick and feels very nasty on the skin. It makes my skin feel waterproof and like a waxy film on my skin. I tried using it after my shower and with wet legs to see if this would help it soak in and feel different, it did not. The small amount I used on my legs just lathered up like I was rubbing soap on my leg instead of lotion and STAYED VISIBLY white (see picture I provided). The lotion has the worse dry waxy feeling I’ve ever tried and even made my legs look very dehydrated, worse than if I had used no lotion at all. It also caused my legs to feel friction when walking and I eventually wiped the it off.

It absorbs quickly and doesn't leave behind that greasy feeling that so many other lotions I've used in the past have done. It's ""unsented"", but that, of course, just means it's free of perfumes, not that it has no smell; it does have a faint plant-ish sort of scent, not the loveliest of scents, but it isn't powerful and doesn't linger at all.Shipping wise, I had the same problem as another reviewer: the bottle opened and got everywhere in its plastic bag.

502,502,B07SS6BN5X,"Amazon Brand - Solimo Aloe Cool Hand & Body Lotion, 24.5 fl oz","Amazon has really done an outstanding job with its Solimo line of skincare products; the large size and low price make these products a great value, and I've found that the formulations are generally just as good as the name brands. The Solimo Aloe Cool Lotion works really well as a body lotion, though it's not quite thick enough to use as a hand lotion on my excessively dry hands.The bottle arrived with tape over the pump dispenser, which helped ensure it stayed closed in transit. (I appreciate that, as I've dealt with leaky products from other online sellers in the past.) It contains a generous 24.5 fl. oz./725 mL of lotion, and I only need a couple of pumps to cover my legs and another pump for my arms. I've included a photo that shows how much lotion is dispensed with one pump, and you can also get an idea of the consistency -- not very runny, but not very thick. It absorbs pretty quickly, and doesn't leave a greasy residue like some lotions do.Given the ""cool"" in the product name, I was hoping it would have a similar cooling sensation to some of the other products I use that have mint, eucalyptus, or tea tree among the ingredients...however, I don't really feel that type of refreshing sensation with this lotion. (It feels nice and soothing, just not particularly ""cool"".) The lotion has a fresh scent; think aloe mixed with cucumbers. Anyone who likes the scent of cucumbers would probably love this, though I tend to prefer more herbal scents like lavender and mint.I should also note that this product has a very long shelf life; the bottle I received in September 2019 doesn't expire until March 2022.Overall, I find this to be a soothing, fresh-smelling, fast-absorbing lotion that is an excellent value for the price. While the cucumber-y scent isn't exactly my preference, Solimo offers plenty of other options...and I look forward to trying more of them in the future. At these prices, I don't see any reason to go back to name brands when Amazon delivers the same quality at a fraction of the cost.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/616ZMPzAoHL.jpg,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/6181dW0AJyL.jpg,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Tf+yi2HQL.jpg,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Wq540LZtL.jpg",dry,"dry_B07SS6BN5X_pid502_0,dry_B07SS6BN5X_pid502_1,dry_B07SS6BN5X_pid502_2,dry_B07SS6BN5X_pid502_3",https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Brand-Solimo-Lotion-Fluid/dp/B07SS6BN5X/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=B07SS6BN5X&qid=1592565158&sr=8-5,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71sszyfKq3L._SL1500_.jpg

(16oz)","I was prepared with my toolbox after reading all the reviews of this product. I was pleasantly surprised when I made one quick turn counter-clockwise and the pump popped up without any drama. Maybe they’ve fixed the problem. I appreciate that it’s not tested on animals or I would never have purchased it.I was really anxious to give this a try for my chronically dry skin. I used a couple of pumps (dime size each) to apply to my hands and arms. Initially, I felt some tackiness that I hoped wouldn’t last. I’m guessing it’s the mineral oil that others have mentioned. It has a pleasant aroma, not overpowering for me at all. The paradox is that it seems really light, but there’s a residue that I can still feel ten minutes later.I’m used to using Shea body butter from the Body Shop as their coconut is a bit oilier (to be expected when coconut oil is a primary ingredient) with a stronger aroma. I have a feeling I’ll be using them both, using this product after a shower or both when maybe I won’t feel the mineral oil ingredient as much.In the end, it’s not unpleasant and i really like the aroma of coconut. It’s a good deal for the price in the 16 oz. size, so I’m not at all sorry I purchased it but it will likely not be my go-to moisturizer.

552,552,B01KJGUUHM,Eucerin Daily Hydration Body Cream with SPF 30 - Broad Spectrum Body Lotion for Dry Skin - 8 oz. Tube,"Review for: Eucerin Daily Hydration Broad Spectrum SPF 30 Hand CreamI am both obsessed with applying sunscreen and moisturizing my hands, so in theory this cream seemed perfect. The good review on Beautypedia also convinced me to buy it. But from my point of view this is a SPF lotion, not a hand cream. And I have bought it as a hand cream, in order to keep protected a part of my body that it's always in the sun.The consistency is similar to regular body sunscreen lotion and this cream leaves a slight white cast. Applied liberally, it also starts `peeling` some imes. It takes a little to be absorbed into the skin, it's somewhat lightweight, but leaves a residue on hands I can feel afterwards. And I hate that feeling on my hands at work or at home during the day. This is definitely not for dry skin, it barely adds any hydration to my hands even reapplied multiple times during the day. After many tries, I ended up using this as a body sunscreen.Also, several weeks after opening it, I started to notice a mild rancid smell. I stored in on my desk at office, which is quite cool.",3.0 out of 5 stars,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81o1kzYDelL.jpg,dry,dry_B01KJGUUHM_pid552_0,https://www.amazon.com/Eucerin-Daily-Hydration-Body-Cream/dp/B01KJGUUHM/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=B01KJGUUHM&qid=1592565326&sr=8-3,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71HP4bZ2gWL._SL1500_.jpg

Because I was told by my niece who is a RN that the best moisturizing lotion you can buy for dry skin is a diabetic lotion. Boy she wasn’t kidding. I have several different lotions on my night stand and not one of them feel as nice as this one..  it truly is very moisturizing. It’s a thicker lotion, but not heavy and glides beautiful on the skin and absorbs right away. There’s no greasy residue what so ever. It’s also fragrance free.  I can honestly say my skin felt awesome all day. I have severely dry skin and I have eczema. This lotion takes care of both. I can’t say enough good things about this lotion.

Anyone with very dry skin will appreciate the Solimo Duabetics’ Skin Moistuirizing Lotion!  It comes to you in a very handy convenient pump bottle.  The “best used by date” is a year and a half away!  Plenty of time to enjoy this size bottle.Each and every Winter, my husband suffers from dry skin. He is not a diabetic, but Winter is harsh on his skin. He often refers to this as his “Winter Itch”.  He has used another leading brand for the last couple years and he was more than surprised that this worked just as well - if not better!The Solimo brand skin moisturizer has a light fragrance andIs not heavy or greasy. I use it on my hands to help protect them fromevil pots and pans I have to wash. Let’s face it, there are many elements that candry out our skin. Do everything you can to protectIt.This product is also helpful for the elderly. Their skin begins to loose elasticity and keeping it moisturized certainly helps. I will be purchasing this for my mom to use on her hands and arms.Absolutely nothing to dislike. I have been swayed by many Solimo brand products.

584,584,B00WB8843Y,"Jergens Wet Skin Body Moisturizer with Refreshing Coconut Oil, 10 Fl Oz (Pack of 1) (Packaging May Vary)","Previous to trying this product I have used a similar product from Eucerin, a skin lotion that you are supposed to apply when you are still wet after a shower, before toweling off.  The Eucerin product sounded like a good idea but in reality it wasn’t. It stayed on the skin and came off on the towel, leaving it greasy and unfit to use again until it was washed, and I don’t wash my towels after every shower.Jergens Wet Skin lotion did better.  But not at first. It seems you can’t get away from the fact that oil and water don’t mix.  When I first applied it the cream turned sticky and gooey. Not a good initial feeling.  But by the time I stepped out of the shower and started toweling off I noticed that the towel wasn’t getting greasy … an improvement over the competitive lotion. By the time I was dry there was no trace of the product on my skin other than the coconut scent.  I mean NO trace. My skin felt exactly the same as it always does, which at this time of year is dry.I see no advantage to using this over using ordinary Jergens lotion as needed throughout the day. Fortunately, if the selling price continues to be about $3 per 6 ounce tube, you are paying about the same for this as regular Jergens lotion, so it becomes entirely a personal choice which to use but it offers no overwhelming advantage over regular lotion.GOOD TO KNOWOver and above the review of how it works, here’s some optional information you may find useful.1. Few consumer products contain more marketing hype than cosmetics and this is certainly no exception.  It promises to “lock in hydration at skin’s peak moisture moment”. Translation? That would mean it seals in your shower water so it can’t be toweled off. A dubious claim.2. It promises to give you “luminous skin”.  That word, luminous, I do not think it means what they think it means. According to the dictionary, luminous means “full of or shedding light; bright or shining, especially in the dark”.  I can assure you that my skin is not shining and I do not glow in the dark as a result of using this product.3. Jergens instructs you to dry yourself by patting yourself dry with the towel. Who does that?4. While they don’t include any specific use directions or warnings they allude to this product being only intended for use on the arms and legs.  From experience I can tell you to keep this away from your private areas and common sense would say to keep it away from your eyes.",4.0 out of 5 stars,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51BZ8iIYIVL.jpg,dry,dry_B00WB8843Y_pid584_0,https://www.amazon.com/Jergens-Moisturizer-Refreshing-Coconut-Packaging/dp/B00WB8843Y/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=B00WB8843Y&qid=1592565565&sr=8-7,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81Hk-%2B4xAQL._SL1500_.jpg

If you enjoy the scent sweet pea from Bath and Body Works, you'll definitely like this scent. Now to review the actual product, it is extremely moisturizing and I am a die hard lotion fanatic. I am using lotion after every single time I was my hands. My hands naturally get pretty dry especially after I do my hair every morning and expose my skin to different hair products. Even using a dime size amount was enough to fully moisturize my hands. This lotion itself is very soothing for my skin and this little bottle will definitely last me considering what little amount you need. I always saw the bigger bottles at Ulta and never purchased them because of the price and I was never able to try this brand until now.

I was offered Hempz 17oz bottle of ""Sweet Raspberry Punch & Champagne Limited Edition"" and thought I might give it a try.Nice bottle, easy open, easy pump no issues there (type 1 plastic recycle if you care about that AND made in the USA, also of note). First thing you're going to notice is the scent. If you like your lotion to definitely have  a fragrance this will please you (as long as you pick a fragrance you like). I tend to be more sensitive to floral scents and I suppose this being berry and whatever champagne is supposed to smell like it didn't bother my sensitivity but it will smack you in the nose with scent. I would not recommend wearing this with other fragrances. I count this particular feature as a good thing because I'd think someone buying lotion partly for the scent wants to smell it. This particular fragrance is heavy on the fruity smell and more of a candied raspberry as opposed to anything sharp.In applying it to the skin it is light, not greasy feeling but does feel like there is a moisture ""barrier"" as they might call it after it is all rubbed in (doesn't hold up too well to hand washing but it's not a hand cream so I give that a pass). Since it is classified as a body moisturizer per the bottle I wouldn't expect it to be heavy and it rubs in fairly quickly. I would not call this a heavy duty lotion and if you need something that's going to be for dry skin I might not start here myself, but I think it would be perfect for anyone with normal skin and you will also smell nice.The height of the fragrance lasts quite a while (for me it was at least an hour), and even after it fades if you were put your arm up to your nose or even walk past someone who hasn't smelled it yet, it will still be noticed. I haven't come across a lotion in my lifetime that will have a scent that will last all day and frankly that's ok with me as long as the fragrance doesn't go stale, and this one didn't. My only warning for you would be if you work in an environment that discourages heavy scents this is NOT the lotion to buy.

Jar","Update: I find I don't want to use this creme - I have to time it so I'm not putting on clothes or not going to bed - it's just too greasy. I've just tried another body cream that is just as thick and emollient that soaks right in and left my skin super soft and silky. I suppose I could use this on my feet after giving myself a pedicure -- in the winter when I'd put on socks.--------------Thick white emollient cream. Large 'jar,' (I posted an image next to a grapefruit so you can see the size better) full of product that should last a long while, and it should last for just under $14 (at time of this review).I will say one thing: this stuff will be great in the winter when the mountain air here is so dry, if I can stand the initial heaviness. I don't have super dry skin, but I'd hoped it would be good for the ""winter drys"" or when my feet need a little extra care. It's very rich and thick. However, don't apply this creme right before you dress or right before bed, because your clothes/sheets will ""stick"" to you. It takes a while for this very rich emollient creme to absorb into the skin.I go barefoot a lot in the summer around the lil log house and wear flip flops, sandals, etc. As some suggested, slathering this on and putting on some socks is a good idea, but unless it's in the winter, it's too hot for socks (and even in the winter I end up ripping off the socks - just can't sleep in them!). Better yet, in the cooler months, during the day I'd slather it on, pull on some cotton socks, and let the creme do its magic.Pros:Very rich and emollientA big ""jar"" that should last a whileThe Eucerin brand - a trusted brandIt's likely great for very dry skin - a good ""winter creme"" (but not for summer, for me anyway)Cons:It's a bit of a mess to use. I think a ""pump action"" application would be easier, but then it's so thick that may be why it isn't presented that way.The price is a little much; however, for 16oz and the Eurcerin brand, it's expected.It's heavy and greasy when applied and takes a bit to let it absorb into the skin.If applied and then you dress or go to bed, your clothes/sheets will stick to youConclusion:I'm on the fence about this product. I always ask myself: would I purchase this product? And the answer is probably not. At least not for my needs. It's just a bit too gloopy for me. However, I do recommend it for someone who has very dry skin and needs something very emollient and thick and rich. I'd use it for my feet to keep them soft and pretty, but only when I can wear some socks until the creme is absorbed.Purchase this if you have ""dry problem"" skin that needs something very thick.",3.0 out of 5 stars,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71jSxmdBSZL.jpg,dry,dry_B01DIXHNUU_pid640_0,https://www.amazon.com/CeraVe-Moisturizing-Lotion-Hyaluronic-Fragrance/dp/B07RK4HST7/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=B07RK4HST7&qid=1592511881&sr=8-641,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51YT4dO6bfL._SL1000_.jpg

Especially feet, hands, knees, elbows, and upper arms.Feet are the worst. Especially your heels. If you are not vigilant you will have the driest, grossest, craft, heels that they make Memes out of. No joke. LOLAnd it's definitely not for lack of personal care or time or effortYou can still use your favorite scented lotions from Bath and Bodyworks, Victoria's Secret, Hempz, etc.But you need something specifically for diabetics. for those certain parts of the body that are more affected than othersThat's where this lotion comes into playUsing it one time I could feel and notice a subtle difference.After multiple daily consistent uses I noticed more than a subtle difference. Was tempted to skip a day or two. That is a no-no.It's very thick, as you can see from my posted picture, while there is no fancy scent, it has a very mild to almost nonexistent smell, but the smell it does have is not particularly unpleasant, but it's not particularly fabulous either. It's like whatever. you can live with it.I started using this twice a day.And as needed in between shower time in the morning and bedtime routine at night.What I like is that it blends in quickly, it's thick enough that it hangs on. You don't feel like it disappears like waterIt does not make you feel greasy or slimy. Even on hot humid summer days.If you have acne prone skin on your face, butt, back. I would think twice before using this in those areas.One night I use this on my face and two days later I had a bunch of small pimples popping up. It was no coincidenceAlthough I do use a small amount on my eyebrows, and ear lobe area. For some reason the areas around my ear lobe and the hard ""nub"" above my ear lobe can get very dry and flaky on occasion.It works fabulous on my feet. Definitely have to remain vigilant with the feet care.I like that it has ceremides, bilberry, and ureaCeraVe is what I call a superstar in hiding. I've been seeing this lotion for a few years now. It gets a few shout outs here in there over the years. Different beauty blogs, different magazine articles, in the Amazon recommended list, etc. etc. but it hasn't really blown up the way I thought it would.It seems now more and more people are using and recognizing and appreciating the cost and quality of this brand.If you are a diabetic, have incredibly dry flaky skin, need a lotion that's a step above, definitely give this a try.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71LPimniCcL.jpg,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71a5kTh67BL.jpg",dry,"dry_B07HRG7FYW_pid650_0,dry_B07HRG7FYW_pid650_1",https://www.amazon.com/CeraVe-Moisturizing-Lotion-Hyaluronic-Fragrance/dp/B07RK4HST7/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=B07RK4HST7&qid=1592511881&sr=8-651,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51YT4dO6bfL._SL1000_.jpg

I've been well aware of CERAVE's stellar reputation for quite awhile and have no good reason why I haven't yet used their skincare products.

I have such sensitive skin that is prone to allergic reactions, and also dry.  None of the lotions I'm currently using contain CERAMIDES -- waxy, lipid molecules made of fatty acids -- that provide key moisturizing benefits to the skin. I use ceramide products on my face and never considered it for the body.  How crazy is that!  I could kick myself a thousand times over for not thinking outside the box and realizing that there are cross-benefits to products like this for someone like me.  While it is made for diabetics, I am also reaping the benefits of CERAVE's reliance on fabulous ingredients that actually work. I'll leave reviews on the effectiveness of the products on diabetic skin to the expertise of diabetic reviewers, as I cannot comment on their experiences. But, this product has transformed me.  Plus, it's lightly and pleasantly scented -- neither a perfumed nor a chemical odor.  I'm ecstatic to have discovered this lotion and will continue to use it.  It definitely taught me to think outside the box when it comes to application of any products that I otherwise would ignore or believe are not designed for me.  Lesson learned.

679,679,B00DG8EZY0,NIVEA Original Daily Moisture Body Lotion - 48 Hour Moisture For Normal To Dry Skin - 16.9 fl. oz. Pump Bottle,"Hi, it's Glamorous Gem, hope you all are having a fantastic day.Anyway, I just wanted to take a little time out of my day to say a couple of things about this lotion.I, unfortunately, switched to this lotion a couple of weeks ago because my Vaseline Advance Repair ran out and I refused to go to another store. This one had a great size and it was on sale so I got it just to try something new.Scent -The scent on this reminds me of deodorant and a cheap powder smelling one at that. I mean, I know they tried to make it smell like it had a clean and fresh scent, but it smells like I rolled in deodorant rather than taking a shower. It is not a pleasant smell at all.Richness and Lather -I bought this one because it says its richness would compare to the Essentially Enriched and it certainly does not. I mean, it does last after you take a shower that day, but not longer. Your skin starts to feel dry and rubbery after just a couple of hours.Overall Feel and Reapplying - Now, I have dry and sensitive skin. I loved Vaseline because it gives you all the moisture for an extended amount of time and its lotion was naturally hypoallergenic and this one does not compare to its claims.My skin was very dryer and worse than before when using this lotion. It has a watered down thickness that makes it messy to apply and it cakes upon reapplying. I felt like my skin was clogged up and dirty compared to fresh and clean with my previous lotion.I felt like it did absolutely nothing to my skin other than aggravate my skin irritations such as atopic dermatitis and eczema. IT IS ABSOLUTELY NOT FOR SENSITIVE SKIN SUFFERERS AT ALL.I agree with another consumer that this product has parabens and those that are more worse for your skin after extended use. Methylparaben and Ethylparaben are very harmful and aggravate tons of skin.I thought I could love this product, but sadly it was a miserable one and I wish I would have just gone somewhere else. It fits nowhere, but the trash. Maybe Nivea might make a better product in the future, but sadly they can consider this a fail and I will not purchase again.Note: This is not promotional content.

The only reason for my 4 stars versus 5 is that it does leave the shower somewhat slippery. Just let the water run for an extra minute once you get out and all is fine.

If someone has them on sale, I really stock up. All of us use it, especially during the winter. When an equivalent Amazon product came up, I grabbed it. At first I was put off by the fact that the Solimo moisturizer seems much waxier in the tub. It looks a bit bubbled and resists scooping with a definitely firm and waxy-seeming texture. The Cetaphil is much creamer and smoother. It takes several seconds longer for the Solimo to soak in, yet after both moisturizers sink in, neither is greasy and each seems to work just as well as the other.I’m assuming that the Solimo brand has more coconut oil, giving it the thicker consistency. I’m uploading pictures to show the Solimo just as you put it on, before it warms up and really starts to sink in, then pictures after showing that, even though it seems waxy, it actually leaves no greasy residue after it warms and is rubbed in.Having used Cetaphil cream for years, I believe the Solimo cream moisturizer is equivalent, even though it takes several seconds longer to soften and sink in.Let Amazon donate to your favorite charity!

It comes beautifully gift boxed even though it's just one item. The first thing I noticed when I looked at the bottle was that it had the easy to use pump and that it is a generously portioned 11 ounces. I glanced at the side of the bottle and WOW! It's organic, its cruelty free, it's fair trade, it's vegan, it's not greasy, it's eco-friendly, has no silicones or sulfates or even any parabens or perfumes in it. I'm in complete amazement!All natural lavender oil is used to fragrance this lotion and I am very happy with the gentle scent. I'm also enthused with the fact that I can read every single ingredient on the side of the bottle and I actually understand what I'm reading, there are no harsh chemicals in this lotion...it is derived from natural ingredients and that is very hard to find. This product was harvested and bottled in Taiwan with loving care, I appreciate that!Now on to the use of the product! I think I had already mentioned before about the gentle lavender scent of this body lotion. I immediately noticed that this particular lotion is not greasy at all but yet retains moisture in my skin all day. I'm using it in the springtime right now and I can feel a difference...that even with the warm weather it's not making me sweat excessively like most lotions would do this time of year. I also noticed that when I use most other lotions I usually have a hard time opening  items around my house after applying them...random things like door knobs, bottles, it's hard to grasp items after using a greasy lotion. This is definitely not a greasy lotion! I'm able to go about my daily routine without having to worry about ""can I get this jar of jelly open after I use this lotion?""",5.0 out of 5 stars,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71oQfFy48OL.jpg,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81QYMiPpU4L.jpg",dry,"dry_B01N20N5FA_pid748_0,dry_B01N20N5FA_pid748_1",https://www.amazon.com/CeraVe-Moisturizing-Lotion-Hyaluronic-Fragrance/dp/B07RK4HST7/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=B07RK4HST7&qid=1592511881&sr=8-701,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51YT4dO6bfL._SL1000_.jpg

We're now on week 2 of daily degreaser scrubbing and it's slowly coming up.  As for how the product feels, I like it, but it's not worth the damage that it's causing to our shower.  Sad to say, I won't buy this again.  I also have a very unhappy husband right now.  Not worth it at all.  Updating from 5 stars to 1, I might give it 5 again if I start showering in the yard, but it'll probably kill our grass.ORIGINAL REVIEW: I think I went through way too much the first time I used it. It's thickness is that of lotion. I think I was expecting more of a soap/lotion combo. Learning curve though, no biggie. A little does go a long way. I loved how this made my skin feel afterwards and the scent is beautiful! I'll be buying this again.Use hot water when rinsing out the shower, cold will leave it slippery. This is no biggie for us as we rinse the shower after every use anyway. No issues there as far as I'm concerned.My skin feels great!

And this is from a woman lol. I want to smell nice, but not overtly like a baked good. Just sayin. This has a pleasing fragrance but goes away fairly quickly and doesn't overpower your shampoo/conditioner/body wash once you get out of the shower. It makes your skin moist without having to put lotion on and then lay on a towel for 10 mins while it dries before ya put clothesOn. Win! The only con is that it does leave an oily residue on the bottom of tub.

Halfway through the bottle and I'm in love with this body wash.I recently got on accutane, a prescription drug that dries out my skin -- so I was on the lookout for an ultra-moisturizing body wash that's gentle on my skin but that also makes me feel like I'm cleaning and refreshing my skin, not just putting a layer of moisture over top of it. I found just what I was looking for.This body wash, along with one from Nivea are definitely my top two favorites at the moment.I'm a huge believer in Aveeno as a brand. I use their face washes, body lotions, sunscreens, etc. However, I had never tried their body washes.One thing that surprised me about this one is that is has a strong refreshing aroma. The scent is awesome. All my other Aveeno products don't really carry a big scent, even the Lavender Lotion I have from Aveeno seems quite mild when it comes to the smell.

787,787,B07GYZX6GB,Love Beauty & Planet Luscious Hydration Body Lotion Coconut Water and Mimosa Flower 13.5 oz,"I feel like I should make this disclaimer-- I loathe lotioning. I once made the argument that swimsuit area skin seemed to manage just fine without requiring the extra maintenance of manual moisturization, making the rest of the limb-y epidermis the needy whiner of skin. Because this is, obviously, a problem area for me I try to aid the process of adulting by finding an enticing lotion. As both a lavender & argan oil enthusiast the combo seemed intriguing. My tipping was the free (paraben, cruelty, dye & silicone) & green (mostly natural, in earth friendlier packaging). To be TMI-y, it puts the lotion on-ing is easier for me in the warmer months when arms 'n legs are easy (and all of the time) access and top of mind. Cold (Ohio) weather becomes a whole *see no evil* + if I didn't do it before I got dressed I missed my opportunity until unclothing time, so this is a clutch time of year. The expectation level for lotion was high af. ...Well, kids, THIS LOTION WAS EVERYTING I NEEDED IT TO BE. It smells faaaaaantastic, imo. Not smash you in the face intense, it's subtle, but if I haven't had the occasion to wash my hands hours later I can still pick up the scent like a wee olfactory gift and who doesn't want that? It also is kinda a dry lotion, which I can now see sounds weird... I suppose what I mean is that once ya rub it in there isn't that have-to-wait-for-your-skin-not-to-be-sticky factor. In what I suspect for most folks is the bottom line, yes, my skin does seem quite soft. Will this be a reorder? Yup.

I have tried the LBAP Rose shampoo, conditioner, and oil before and loved it. SO I thought why not try a different scent for lotion. I did read the reviews on Amazon before buying the product and the biggest skepticism I had was about the smell. AND I really should have listened to my gut and the previous reviews. The scent is so strong. My roommate told me I smell like an old lady or a very annoyingly strong-scented plant. I even got the matching deodorant with this product and I dislike that product more because every time I would move my arms I felt attacked by the scent.

Day and Night Moisturizer for Men and Women","First off let me say— I am a huge fan of this product. I have been looking for the perfect facial moisturizer that was a hybrid between natural oils/a gel consistency. I hit the lottery finding this one.All the other 'gel' or 'hydrating' creams or lotions I've tried would eventually dry down and leave my skin more of a sticky surface causing friction if I touched it rather than being silky smooth and hydrated.This cream is rich due to the oils (a little goes quite a long way), however, not heavy at all. It glides onto the skin, thins out into an oil/gel consistency, and is incredibly easily absorbed by the skin while still leaving a luminous glow (that is especially beautiful when it hits the sun). I definitely don't think it looks shiny or oily, just provides this lasting luminosity and nourishment.As for the scent, it has a light & pleasant lavender scent. The scent dissipates with time and becomes more faint.Overall really loving this product and so glad I found it. I don't think I'll be looking for any other moisturizers because this one fits all my needs and is made from mama earth's ingredients :)",5.0 out of 5 stars,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61NJvpU65RL.jpg,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61ZupTwHOPL.jpg,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/717Xhz9upSL.jpg,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71s5uWGvbcL.jpg",dry,"dry_B072NBD1L1_pid818_0,dry_B072NBD1L1_pid818_1,dry_B072NBD1L1_pid818_2,dry_B072NBD1L1_pid818_3",https://www.amazon.com/CeraVe-Moisturizing-Lotion-Hyaluronic-Fragrance/dp/B07RK4HST7/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=B07RK4HST7&qid=1592511881&sr=8-701,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51YT4dO6bfL._SL1000_.jpg

What horrible things to put in an acne fighting productSulphur products normally work Great on acneWHAT HAPPENEDI started using this as I was coming down from a bad breakout, I was going to a wedding in a few days which with my normal acne cycles and healing should've been gone by the wedding (with my normal sulphur drying lotion).  I ran out and saw this on sale.  It was my mistake to just assume they were essentially the same. They were except a few major ingredients! My skin kept getting more and more inflammed, deeper painful knobs were coming up.  I was wondering if I had eaten something.  It just wasn't stopping.  One night I was actually in hives down my chin to my neck!  Later I noticed that I was getting what looked to be just plain cysts..pure inflammation no whitehead or anything.  I was pulling my hair out like what is happening.  I decided to take a look at the ingredients in this imposter. Talc and titanium dioxide... Really!? Who does that? I quick washed it off and ordered Eradikate my normal drying lotion, express shipping.  I will NEVER do that again.

846,846,B0017SWIU4,"Mario Badescu Drying Lotion, 1 Fl Oz","All of the reviews on this product were SO mixed it seriously made me hesitate getting it because of how many things can apparently go wrong. So I flipped a coin lol and decided to purchase this item that I had high hopes for and I don’t regret it. Shipping was fast and came within 4-5 days. My lil jar came in a small bubble wrapped zip lock bag and was also surrounded by bubble wrap in the box it was shipped in, so it did not come broken like I feared. It did come shaken of course but just leaving it for a good hour or two did the trick :). When I finally tried the product it was amazing! I feared the results of some people where their acne or breakouts got worse but thankfully this did not happen to me. This product definitely reduced redness and helped push up the impurity to take it out effortlessly. Many were frustrated that this product came off in the night on their pillow but I will admit this product takes self control haha especially for a wiggly worm like myself. Depending on where I have the product I will only let myself sleep on one side or if I have it on varying spots I just stay on my back. When I did forget and moved everywhere causing it to come off the results weren’t as good as when I stayed still and allowed the product to do its thing. Overall I’m in love with this product and definitely will repurchase!! I’m glad I took the risk and if your someone wanting to get this product but aren’t sure,I recommend physically buying it to spend less if you get different results.

Let me first say that this product is by far the best I have ever used. My skin is more suptle, glowing and healthier looking than it ever has been. The cream is more gel like, cooling and non scented so you dont have to worry about any off putting smells. Secondly, you only need very little as it goes a long way. Easy, non greasy application and doesn't itch or peel. I am sold and I highly recommend this product to anyone whom has tried other creams or facial gels and they have failed.

I myself suffer from severe eczema which doesn't have a calendar; it's like a volcano (only wakes when it wants to and is extremely grouchy when it does).  Having said that, this product was  selected because it has  ingredients which are nature derived and really, I wanted to try something that would help alleviate the symptoms, badly. The product is moisturizing when applied to my healthy skin; however, when I tried it on the eczematic skin (which didn't have broken skin, just raised, angry bumps) it actually made that area more angry.  I tried it 2x a day, for two weeks to see if the burning sensation would subside but each time, it burned and so I had to stop using it for my eczematic skin.  I don't blame the product, it's just that it didn't work for me, hence, the 4 stars.

The ingredients list pictured on Amazon is not the same as what you get on the package. Second most utilized ingredient is emulsifying wax (not coconut oil), which clogs poors.

The amount you get is not worth almost 15 dollars (placed beside a lip scrub for comparison). Maybe 7 or 8, but not 15.

1021,1021,B086LJM3XH,"Cetaphil Daily Advance Ultra Hydrating Lotion for Dry/sensitive Skin, Fragrance Free, 20 Ounce Pump Bottle","A good, heavier body moisturizer. Cetaphil's current packaging shows it is the ""middle"" of their lineup.Here in the mid-Atlantic (with our humid summers), I use it mostly during winter cold snaps, and use Cetaphil's lighter ""All Skin Types"" most of the time. Those of you living in dry climates might find it useful year around. The ingredient list is similar to that lighter lotion, but swaps the avocado oil for macadamia nut oil, and adds shea butter.The lotion is moderately heavy, you can feel it on your skin (likely the shea butter), and if you wash your hands too soon, you'll notice the slickness. I'm not a fan of this weight of lotion normally since it gets on things, and I don't want to pet my cats with it on my hands. But if you're suffering from dry skin or chapping, this is the way to go. And it's not particularly heavy or greasy compared to other heavier lotions I've tried.The odorless is worth extra praise. Manufacturers today seem to fill most products with cloying, overwhelming scents. As a typical male, I'm not really interested in my lotion (or me) smelling like cheap perfume. Worse, many synthetic scent compounds are implicated as health hazards. So an unscented lotion is the only way to go for me. Kudos for Cetaphil doing that across their product line.The packaging changes occasionally (including since last year), but the ingredients seem to stay the same. The current product photo here isn't the new packaging, so I've included a pic of it here.This is my go-to lotion during excessively dry spells.

Aquaphor products work well to protect the skin barrier, plus add and lock in moisture.  This Aquaphor ointment body spray is easy to apply.  However, it is quite greasy and goes everywhere when sprayed.  To me, it is very similar to spray-on sunscreens.  Sprays cover larger areas more quickly when compared to lotions or ointments, but they are messy.  When using sunscreen sprays, I apply them outside, so it is not much of an issue.  However, I would not apply this Aquaphor body spray outside, nor do I want the oily mist all over my floors or carpet, and it is too greasy to apply in the shower.

I use their body lotion and have been using it for years. I have VERY touchy and sensitive skin. In addition, I have very dry skin AND eczema. I was told by my dermatologist years ago to use Aquaphor and I’ve been using it since. I really like the concept of the spray. It’s so easy to apply and literally still sprays upside down. It’s great for hard to reach places like your back. FYI: this spray lotion is on the heavier side. But when you have severely dry skin.... this spray is a God send. It stays on all day.. even after I’ve washed my hands... I can still feel it. There is no scent... it’s fragrance free and it’s hypoallergenic. It sprays with a continuous mist. A little goes a long way.  It’s perfect! My skin feels nice and soft after 3 days using it both morning and night.

The serum is the consistency of water but it’s potent, which it needs to be if you want results.  It also makes my skin more sensitive to sun burn.

1113,1113,B00MMKAM5E,"Gold Bond Rough & Bumpy Daily Skin Therapy, 8 Ounce","We have been using this 2x a day for 8 weeks on my child's KP on his arms and legs. His skin is softer and less red. I hadn't seen any drastic improvement after 4 weeks (before/after picture). He still had a lot of KP bumps and redness. I thought this product would smooth the bumps, not just soften skin like other moisturizers.After 6 weeks, the redness is getting better and there are less bumps, but the KP has not been eliminated.After 8 weeks, there is still a small cluster of KP bumps, but the redness has been significantly reduced. There are less bumps because of the intense moisture; this cream does not exfoliate.One positive aspect of this product is that you do not need to use a lot for it to work. After 2 months we have used less than half of the jar (using it 2x a day on my child's arms and legs).His skin is much less dry, but the cream itself is sticky, not silky.  It almost feels like residue from hair gel/spray. I always have to wash my hands after applying it. For the price, I would have liked it to be smoother and completely eliminate KP.Will update again after another month.**Last update**Not much changed after the last update, so we tried something new. We ended up giving up gluten, and the bumps completely vanished for good. They have been eliminated for a year now! If it’s the KP, then changes in diet may be the solution (I’m not a doctor).

1129,1129,B06XWC9DGK,"Tree Hut 24 Hour Intense Hydrating Shea Body Butter Moroccan Rose, 7oz, Hydrating Moisturizer with Pure Shea Butter for Nourishing Essential Body Care","This is, hands down, one of the best, thickest, richest, most hydrating body cream I have used yet.But there are a few things you need to know about me to understand why I say what I do. 1.) I am 41. My skin care and body creams have all come from grocery or drug stores because I have always been p. broke most of my life. My go-to body creams or lotions for everyday used to either come from Vaseline, Aveeno, or gold bond. I wasn't choosy and I couldn't afford to be.Before using this, my most favorite body lotion was an expensive 20 dollarish bottle of lavender cream from another company. And don't get me wrong...That stuff is still great.But dang if this little bottle under 7 bucks has just replaced that. I'm sad I didn't buy one of these to try before I got the 20 dollar bottle!A few more notes before I start that are important too, if you are considering getting this based on my glowing review. I don't have any perfume or scent or fruit or food allergies. My skin is very forgiving when it comes to scented things and I do not suffer from migraines triggered by strong scents or reactions caused by perfumes. So for me, this scented body cream doesn't bother me at all. If you find yourself having issues with perfumed or scented items that touch skin, you MAY want to be cautious. And if you have very sensitive skin--I do not know. So keep that in mind. What works for me, may not work at all for you.PROS:- I have Amazon prime. So! When I ordered this, it arrived the next day!- Arrived in perfect condition, boxed and packaged with several other items. No broken safety seal or damaged anything.- First thing: The smell. Ooohhh man. It smells absolutely amazing. Mango? Yes. Some sort of tropical fruit vacation get-a-way with tropical drinks and ripe fruit and beaches? Certainly brings that to mind to me.- Thiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiick. This is a nice, thick cream. It kept that thickness too, despite being delivered in a box during 100+ degree weather. When I was done inhaling the smell to my delight, running my fingers over the top gently only picked up a little bit. BUT!- A little bit is GOOD. A little touch with middle and index fingers was enough to rub into both my hands, wrists and then fore arms.- Absorbs FAST. So rub gently, but quickly if possible. My skin drank this cream in.- No stickiness.- No left over residue or ""white streaks,"" hard to rub into skin. Disappeared almost immediately.- Light refreshing scent.- Today is day 2 using this morning and night. Skin immediately feels 100% softer and smoother and stays that way! Even when I was finished putting some on after my shower tonight (and hour before writing this) I could still feel how soft and smooth my skin was!-My skin feels very well hydrated and so much so that it's actually noticeable if I MISS a spot! The skin I missed with this shea butter feels drier and papery compared to the hydrated smoothness.I am VERY satisfied with this shea butter body cream.CONS:- The only con I can think of is for people with scent triggered migraines/scent allergies/very delicate skin. I don't have any of these issues, so I cannot judge what this cream would do in that case.Otherwise, if you don't suffer from any of the above sensitivities YES I do recommend! 100%",5.0 out of 5 stars,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61RhyXY3E2L.jpg,dry,dry_B06XWC9DGK_pid1129_0,https://www.amazon.com/CeraVe-Moisturizing-Lotion-Hyaluronic-Fragrance/dp/B07RK4HST7/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=B07RK4HST7&qid=1592511881&sr=8-701,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51YT4dO6bfL._SL1000_.jpg

It is now called ""Curel Daily Moisture Comforting Lotion for Dry Skin.""  Even the Curel website has not completely updated the product page at this time (April 2015), as it shows the new label and ingredient list but with the old title, ""Curel Daily Moisture Original Lotion.""It is a mildly viscous, translucent white lotion with a very faint and inoffensive sweet floral fragrance that fades in just a few minutes.It is easy to apply even to large areas of the body.  Unusual for a lotion, it leaves a palpable but non-greasy film that improves the texture of the skin, making it feel moist and smooth.  It does do a surprisingly good job soothing itchy or prickly skin.Because it is a lotion rather than a creme, it is not the best choice for truly diseased or damaged skin, but it is an excellent choice to soothe and protect healthy skin when it is irritated.Ingredients:  Water, glycerin, distearyldimonium chloride, petrolatum, isopropyl palmitate, cetyl alcohol, dimethicone, methylparaben, ethylparaben, fragrance, sodium chloride, cetyl-PG hydroxyethyl palmitamide, butylene glycol, Butyrospermum parkii (shea) butter, Eucalyptus globulus leaf extract, gelatin, Acacia senegal gum.",5.0 out of 5 stars,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31pbka3UgPL.jpg,dry,dry_B003A86J18_pid1176_0,https://www.amazon.com/CeraVe-Moisturizing-Lotion-Hyaluronic-Fragrance/dp/B07RK4HST7/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=B07RK4HST7&qid=1592511881&sr=8-701,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51YT4dO6bfL._SL1000_.jpg

I have extremely dry hands- all year round, no matter how much water I drink, what soap I use, what lotion I use. They bleed often and it's been like this since I was a kid and was getting sent to the nurse over it. Nothing made a difference- any lotion, eczema cream, psoriasis treatment. I've tried the puck style O'Keefe's before and it acted like any other lotion. I can feel my skin split apart when I make a fist. Needless to say, when it's not painful it's itchy and otherwise uncomfortable. I had totally given up- I've lived with this for 25 years, why continue to fight it? I'd adjusted to the discomfort. The before pictures are from when I was applying lotion each night and sleeping in gloves and putting lotion on every time I got my hands wet. That's a huge hassle and is terrible to sleep in, plus I go through tons of lotion. Recently, someone asked me how I burned my hands and I spiked me to look into remedies again since I realized my coworkers probably think I'm diseased and I don't want to be bleeding all day at work. On a last ditch effort before going to the doctor for real, I tried this stuff. It fixed my hands in a couple days, with only 3 applications a day. It has improved my quality of life tremendously. I can wash my hands without pain and they look 50 years younger. I have never had something solve any problem so completely, quickly, and easily. This is, hands down (ha), the best stuff I've ever used.

Sadly, I’m disappointed to say the tube I received from amazon did not compare to the formula I have loved from other purchases. The lotion has a weird/bad scent which I’ve never encountered before, and the formula seems watery. To the point that last night when going to squeeze some onto my hand, clear/milky liquid poured out onto my hand and bed sheets. Not a fun surprise. I tried shaking the tube and was able to get some lotion formula out to use but I am now wary as I do not understand why it had separated. I also feel the lotion is greasier than other tubes I’ve used. I believe I got a bad tube, perhaps expired but I can’t seem to figure out where the product would show a packaged date to know for sure.

However, when I spotted the tube, I had to get it. As someone with OCD, the thought of using my finger or having to share with someone else was a bit too much for me. This is perfect. I can now share with my coworkers when needed. Now let me tell you about how good this works. I wash my hands over 20 times a day. This causes my hands to dry up. I am not too good about applying this consistently either. I probably use this product 2-3 times per day. My hands were so dry; there were about 50 small little cuts on them. I kid you not, that many. After using this for two days consistently, the pain went away and my hands healed. I feel like even after washing my hands the cream stays on my hands and moisturizes them. This cream has truly been a blessing. The best part about this is that is non-greasy and unscented. The texture of the tube is a little different than the tub when applied in large quantity but not bad at all. I have one at work, one in the car and one at home.

I saw that it was well reviewed so I decided to give it a try. Sometimes products have fake reviews but I saw that the wash is made with quality ingredients so I gave it a go. When I received the face wash I compared it to the face wash I have been using for the last year.I was really happy to see that the Brickell Face Wash has less ingredient and every ingredient is clarified in layman’s terms. For example, the first few ingredients are Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Leaf Juice), Aspalathus Linearis (Rooiboos), and Olea Europaea (Olive Oil). I was also happy to see that most (if not all) of the ingredients are natural.The scent of the face wash is so pleasant—almost tea like—and it does not overwhelm or smell chemical-y like my previous wash. I love that the wash is light and easy to squeeze out so I don’t end up wasting or trying to put it back. It’s nice that they also offer unscented for those who are scent-sensitive.I decided to research Brickell further and I was ecstatic to see that a sample kit of all of the products is offered for free. The kit arrived fairly  quickly and some of the samples ended up lasting a really long time!I am really happy that I discovered Brickell products and I recommend it to my guy friends (and even some of my girl friends that prefer male-branded products). I definitely recommend checking out the website and giving the sample kit a try. Brickell has made me more interested in skin care and being mindful about what I put on my body.I have sensitive skin so not every product works for me.

1248,1248,B01M69QJNZ,"O'Keeffe's K0680001-2 Working Hands Hand Cream in Jar (2 Pack), 6.8 oz","This product is extremely helpful and nourishing for your hands. I work outside all day and have to deal with getting my hands wet in the cold air so my hands take a beating. This product gives my hands the moisture they desperately need and keep them from cracking. Also, this helps a lot for grip, keeping a hold of things with having the proper moisture in your hands. It rubs into your skin extremely quick and is not greasy at all. It does have a very slight tacky feel after application, but with more retained moisture in your hands, I do believe this is to be expected and normal. Now, lets get to the issue of the size of containers. I made a purchase from another website, and the containers were advertised as 6.8 ounces, and when I received them, they were 5.4 ounces. In the photo you can clearly see that the 6.8 ounce does not have an ounce marking on top, so the sellers are putting that photo up and then sending the 5.4 ounce containers instead. This is a huge mistake by the company in my opinion, but not the only one. They also marked both as ""value size"", which is mistake number 2. I can see one of them that way, but not both. To me the 6.8 ounce should be marked as the value size and at the same or barely more than the price of the 5.4 ounce, validating the ""value"" of the size. Either way, the bosses at this company really messed this up. I feel the need to get the word out there on this as I got stung and wish to keep others from having it happen to them, so BUYER BEWARE!!! Now, also let me be clear on this - this product, provided by Amazon IS AS ADVERTISED! 6.8 ounces and the one that is 6.8 ounces in this photo is one of the 2 from this purchase.

Something like lotion is tricky since we all have our personal preference. I wanted natural ingredients, something that smells nice but not flowery or heavily scented, something that wasn't too watery and something that did the job I require of lotion... moisturize, not leave a sticky residue, make my skin feel and look healthy. I live in Arizona and part time in Hawaii. I need good lotion even in Hawaii since my skin dries out super easily.I saw great reviews about Hempz but some liked the scent, some really didn't at all. I went with this small bottle to try it since I like carrying some with me.It arrived two days ago and I've used it constantly since. The scent is stronger than I normally like but it's a pleasant smell. I think it smells a bit vanilla bit shea buttery. My boyfriend said he thinks it smells good, and described the smell ""I think it smells like lotion, not like a scent but like lotion itself"" so, take that for what it's worth lol! He liked it tho.I prefer to use healthy products as much a possible but the ingredients list is so small on here (tiny bottle, not the manufacturing fault lol) I really can't read it so I need to look it up before purchasing a big bottle. If everything seems non toxic I'm going to grab a big bottle of this stuff. The scent isn't overpowering but I do notice it all day... in a good way though.Fit my criteria, isn't oily, absorbs leaving no weird leftovers. It makes my skin feel soft, it's a thick lotion that my skin seems to love. Also, it doesn't smell hempy, I didn't want a strong smell of hemp and this has none, huzzah!Should anything change after using this for a longer period of time I will update my review. I'm glad they have these small bottles available since I hate wasting money and products when they don't work out. I hope they have all the scents in mini size since I would love to try them all!! Plus the small bottles can be refilled as needed so I always have one for my bag, car, travel etc.I'm happy! 5 stars from me!",5.0 out of 5 stars,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71pGnf0iYkL.jpg,dry,dry_B004NIWLAM_pid1259_0,https://www.amazon.com/CeraVe-Moisturizing-Lotion-Hyaluronic-Fragrance/dp/B07RK4HST7/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=B07RK4HST7&qid=1592511881&sr=8-701,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51YT4dO6bfL._SL1000_.jpg

1282,1282,B07BRDVK2L,"Amlactin Alpha Hydroxy Therapy Rapid Relief Restoring Lotion & Ceramides, 7.9 Oz","I'd posted this photo to a Facebook beauty group because I needed help with two choices. I wanted something with ceramides but was torn between my dermatologist recommended Amlactin Cerapeutic  (now called Rapid Relief) and CeraVe SA (because I'm a CeraVe lover).I wanted three conditions addressed; Crepey texture above the knees, desert crack dryness below the knees, and also KP (keratosis pilaris, albeit mild) on the upper arms.I bought the Cerave SA first because I found it first. It exfoliated well and I noticed smoothness on the legs as well as arms but I also noticed dryness. And when I say 'dryness' I mean to say that the skin didn't feel particularly hydrated after a few days. The Salicylic Acid, at least in my case, may be the drying culprit because Ammonium Lactate has always been hydrating for me. I learned only later that SA may be drying for some skin types and maybe, therefore, is excellent for others.A week later when I found the Amlactin Rapid Relief (specifically; as opposed to Amlactin anything else), I purchased it, wondering if it would do better for me and it did.1.) Medium thick texture, not annoying light or thick; no noticeably strong or too bothersome smell.2.) It's a little oily after application but absorbs within 10 minutes or so, depending on how dry I am.3.) After absorption, a hydrating feel occurs.4.) The next day, still not feeling dry.5.) After a couple of days, arm texture also improves.6.) After a couple of days, lower legs can go days without treatment & still look hydrated.7.) After maybe 7 days, I noticed remarkable above the knee crepe softening, about 20% of my personal ideal.In a perfect world, maybe I'd have used this every other day for even faster improvement, but every 3rd day was good enough for me. In 6 weeks I'm at 100% of my (de-crepe & de-parchy) goals with my legs.I'm at 75% with arms but this KP has only ever been mild and hardly noticeable so had it been worse I'd have had greater results even in my twice or so weekly applications.Consistency is key and especially the more extreme the condition. In the daytime, I always used a daily sunscreen (with antioxidants & ceramides) doubled up on areas I was treating. Also, avoid direct sun exposure for at least a week after treatment goals are achieved due to increased solar sensitivity.",5.0 out of 5 stars,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51byPCdcQDL.jpg,dry,dry_B07BRDVK2L_pid1282_0,https://www.amazon.com/CeraVe-Moisturizing-Lotion-Hyaluronic-Fragrance/dp/B07RK4HST7/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=B07RK4HST7&qid=1592511881&sr=8-701,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51YT4dO6bfL._SL1000_.jpg

This cream is very thick, I warm it in the palm of my hand so it is applied easier and absorbs faster.My most common use for it  us for dry and cracked heels and it helps me keep them crack free and pain free. The cream is rich and protective on  my heels but it leave my hands with a film of cream as well and requires hand washing. It is a small price to pay for having the protective film on my problem areas.Overall:1. It is effective2. It is unscented3. The effect lasts a fairly long time, I apply it once a day4. The same cream comes in variety of containers.  I use a big tub at home, and carry a small tube in my purse.I have been using it for many years. I tried other creams but keep coming back to Eucerin.Ali Julia review",5.0 out of 5 stars,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/3125t1WoD4L.jpg,dry,dry_B001FB5IIC_pid1289_0,https://www.amazon.com/CeraVe-Moisturizing-Lotion-Hyaluronic-Fragrance/dp/B07RK4HST7/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=B07RK4HST7&qid=1592511881&sr=8-701,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51YT4dO6bfL._SL1000_.jpg

Body and Facial Oils for Men and Women 4oz","I am a skin and haircare product junkie and have tried many products and brands over the years; from inexpensive drug store brands to high end department store potions and the ""cosmeceuticals"" my esthetician has recommended. This oil stands out as a star for me in a few ways.Let me begin by noting that I purchased the unscented oil and it is NOT unscented. The lavender is particular comes through. If that's a deal breaker for you, don't try this product. Lavender is noted as an ingredient in the description and I wondered about that, thinking it may not be truly unscented, but at a price point of $14.99 for 4 ounces, what the hey. Gotta try it at least.On to the good stuff... this is a high quality, pure oil. It feels so good going on and absorbs well. I live in Michigan and have been using this literally from the top of my head down to my toes. It's been a brutal winter lately and the oil has been especially useful for my hands, nails, hair (for a touch of shine and taming flyaways), feet, and face. As I think about it, this may be the best all purpose product I have tried, period!In the photos provided here, one is of my 58 year old face :) After putting on my makeup, I have started the habit of using about 5-7 drops-massage into cuticles then dab my cheeks lightly with the oil left on my fingertips for a little highlight/shine. I swear to God it does something to my circulation! It gives a bit of natural glow to my face that lasts all day!As stated above, this is scented although it is listed as unscented. I like the scents that the Aveda brand offers, particularly their stress-fix composition oil. This oil smells very much like stress-fix; not as strong as Aveda's oil, which I appreciate for use on my face. I am not a fan of scented facial anything and have quite sensitive facial skin. The photo shows the $14.99 four ounce bottle of this oil, alongside the $24 one ounce, and $30 - 1.7 ounce Aveda composition oil...4 oz for $14.99 or 1 oz for $24!!! Hmmm??? Sorry, Aveda :( won't be buying this from you anymore. At $15 bucks, it's a small gamble which has become a big WIN for me.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61rDGb2cy9L.jpg,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71QrDclE-kL.jpg",dry,"dry_B07KYD25MF_pid1301_0,dry_B07KYD25MF_pid1301_1",https://www.amazon.com/CeraVe-Moisturizing-Lotion-Hyaluronic-Fragrance/dp/B07RK4HST7/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=B07RK4HST7&qid=1592511881&sr=8-701,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51YT4dO6bfL._SL1000_.jpg

I recommend you exfoliate before applying this, (or any) self-tanner, especially your knees, ankles, and elbows. It goes on white, then develops during the rest of the day.

Even though I'm only 26 I still try to take care of myself when it comes to the sun, especially my face.I had been eyeing this stuff for a few months. Back in April I had gone tanning in a tanning bed a handful times at my gym. I had a wedding to go to in the beginning of May and being pale with a red dress & white heels is a no no. Every time I set foot into a tanning bed I always feel guilty because of the dangers of tanning beds. I only go a few times before the summer starts otherwise it isn't a usual habit of mine but the guilt is still there lol. I've always wanted to try a spray tan but I work in a swimming pool year round and I've always been nervous about the color bleeding out into the pool.Anyway, after I had attended the wedding I went to, I had stopped going tanning for about three or three and a half weeks. At this point I wasn't really that tan anymore, especially my skin being dried out from the water. I saw this stuff again at my local Walmart. I've been wanting to try it so I finally took the plunge. I have to say I've only used it twice, but I'm pleasantly surprised how well it works and how good it looks. I've tried a few self tanners in the past. I tried Hempz a few years back and it made me look super orange and streaky after three or four times. I tried another Jergen's lotion and it was so so. This is my holy grail! I live for moisturizers because of my dry skin due to the pool. I don't look orange, the color doesn't run in the pool, it doesn't transfer onto my clothes, it's not streaky or messy to apply, and there's no weird smell. It actually smells pretty decent. I love this stuff and the color not running is huge for me since most days I'm wet in a pool.The last time I had went tanning was three weeks ago which could possibly make this review a little biased, but I really notice a big difference when my tan from going tanning had faded.I'd definitely purchase this stuff again. I haven't tried putting it on my face. I'm not sure if you're supposed to, but for my body it's great so far! I'm actually going to try and use this more as opposed to laying out in the sun this summer.",5.0 out of 5 stars,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71rur54IizL.jpg,dry,dry_B01NADTX4F_pid1338_0,https://www.amazon.com/CeraVe-Moisturizing-Lotion-Hyaluronic-Fragrance/dp/B07RK4HST7/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=B07RK4HST7&qid=1592511881&sr=8-701,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51YT4dO6bfL._SL1000_.jpg

I started above and below my knees and above and below my elbows before rubbing on those areas. I immediately patted dry with my towel. I rubbed over my feet, knees, elbows, and wrists with my towel. Then I used a little baby powder on those areas especially where tanner tends to over soak.

I'm that gross kinda pale where you can see my veins and I'm going to Vegas in a month. I figured I'd see if I could get away with this.So it does give you a subtle glow, but you have to be really careful you dont sweat after application, which is hard to do after a shower (I get shower sweats sometimes). If you do you will get a streak like I have. You have to get an exfloiater brush as well to make sure it doesn't build up around knees, ankles, elbows, ect.It also does still smell. That self tanning smell that's a little like corn chips. It is slightly less than their other lotion, but it is still clearly there.So, IMO, this stuff works just like the other dry skin lotion, except it's a bit more of a hassle. It really depends on what you need out of a tanning lotion.If you want just a bit of color and a little less of a smell, with the added bonus of being an ""in shower"" lotion; this is for you.If you want a self tanner, but are too scared to try the ones with the gloves, just do their normal tanning lotion. It's a lot simpler, even if it smells just a bit stronger.

Miraculously, the heat from my hand has not melted the lotion into a greasy blob traveling down my skin,  thereby highlighting the reason for my ridiculous picture: this stuff is potent and thick!  For a New England girl like me, the consistency of lotion makes ALL the difference.  I’m not going to mess around with weak formulas that just can’t keep my skin hydrated.  New Hampshire winters demand more, and Joy Lane Farm delivers on all fronts.Pros:- Goes on smooth and rubs in completely.- Smells great!  Subtle and natural... the lemongrass scent comes through more powerfully for me than the lavender.- Solid ingredients.  No garbage or questionable “perfume blends”.- (Most importantly) my dry, sad hands are finally rehydrated and I’m not getting those bothersome tiny cracks at the knuckles.- I love that the lotion was actually made by Joel and Katy, whose names are on the back of the bottle.  This is no factory-produced glop, it’s made with love and precision by their own two hands.Cons:- I wish it came in purse-friendly sizes!

This is a lovely body lotion with a very distinctive sweet aroma like a raspberry sherbet.  The lotion has a medium consistency like a thick milk but more liquid than a cream.  It is easy to massage into my skin and it disappears quickly enough allowing me to get dressed without fear of residue getting on my clothes.  The main active ingredients are Aloe Vera, extracts of Wheat Straw, Cocoa Butter, Sunflower Seed Oil, Sesame Seed Oil and Sweet Almond Oil, among others.  I always investigate the composition before using any skin care, but BioSphère have done all the work for me:  on their website each ingredient is listed with a clear description of what it is and what it does.  Really exceptional disclosure and very helpful if you care about such things.  These products are also free of harmful chemicals, parabens, phthalates and sulfates and not tested on animals.The stylish dark purple bottle has a pump dispenser that works well and locks by twisting,  to stop any post-usage drips.  The contents (200 ml) should last well.  I have been slathering this lotion on legs and arms daily for the last five weeks and there is lots still left.This luscious body lotion has not caused any irritation or adverse reaction (not surprising as all the ingredients are natural and more than half are organically-grown in France, where they take these things seriously).

This is a hydrating aloe vera based CREAM. The consistency is like a standard lotion, perhaps a tiny bit thinner. I used this before bed last night and woke up feeling like my skin was soft and still well hydrated. Keep in mind, I have super dry skin and use a humdifier overnight to help keep me hydrated.During the day, especially in the winter, I use a homemade shea butter and coconut oil based lotion which is SUPER thick. I used this instead this morning and at first, I was a little worried it wouldn't be hydrating enough, but I am through the day and my skin hasn't been itchy or dry feeling at all. I still prefer my thicker stuff in these dry winter months, but I will use this at night as I love the way I felt this morning!I was very happy to see the ingredients on the label and alcohol being fairly far down the list. Also, the statement that they are made without parabens or sulfates and predominately organic. The scent is so faint I can barely tell it is there, which I prefer and I LOVE that they do not test on animals.Overall, this is a nice hydrating cream. It is thinner in texture but works well.

1366,1366,B00AO1YZ60,"Alba Botanica Very Emollient Coconut Rescue Body Lotion, 32 oz","I've loved this lotion (Maximum Dry Skin) for years. At first I loved it without reservation. Then, as many have pointed out, the formula changed. It still worked well in the sense of treating very dry skin, but it was waxier (both in texture and in smell), didn't rub in quite as well, and, most frustratingly, you could only get about 75% of the product out of the bottle. In 2014 I ordered 4 of the big 32 ounce sized bottles and one by one, I got about 75% finished and no more would pump out, like a too-thick milkshake. I even bought some of those bottle coupler things and the lotion sat upside down on top of another quarter-full bottle for weeks and STILL didn't move out of the bottle. Eventually I gave up and threw them away. I have used other lotions since then, but did purchase one of the smaller size when I was desperate. Again, waxy smell and feel, and 75% of the way through, I stopped being able to pump it.Cut to yesterday, it was on sale at Whole Foods so I picked up another quart, expecting to again only get to use three quarters of it, but being ok with that since it really works the best for my dry winter skin. But when I went to put it on after my shower, I was surprised that the texture was much looser (in a good way), and it rubbed in much easier than my previous bottle. I have only used it once, but I believe that this one will pump out all the way. Only giving four stars because I'm annoyed at the continued reformulations, but I'm optimistic that the right stuff is back!Photos showing: 1: new good bottle (left) vs old bad (this is how much product is left when I can no longer get any out), 2: batch codes for good (L) and bad (R) 3: was stabbing around with the straw trying to get some out and the holes just stay there.

I love coconut scented lotion and decided I’d give Alba a try. FIRST, the scent is HORRIBLE! There’s a tiny (very tiny) hint of coconut coming from the bottle BUT as soon as you rub the lotion on your skin, there’s no trace of coconut smell at all...INSTEAD, it smells like playdough! I’ve neversmelt anything so gross for a lotion. If you’re looking for a nice smell of coconut, do not be fooled. SECONDLY, this lotion is very thick and feels very nasty on the skin. It makes my skin feel waterproof and like a waxy film on my skin. I tried using it after my shower and with wet legs to see if this would help it soak in and feel different, it did not. The small amount I used on my legs just lathered up like I was rubbing soap on my leg instead of lotion and STAYED VISIBLY white (see picture I provided). The lotion has the worse dry waxy feeling I’ve ever tried and even made my legs look very dehydrated, worse than if I had used no lotion at all.

It absorbs quickly and doesn't leave behind that greasy feeling that so many other lotions I've used in the past have done.
