0,0,B07RK4HST7,CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion | 19 Ounce | Face & Body Lotion for Dry Skin with Hyaluronic Acid | Fragrance Free,"Just want to let everyone know that the cerave lotion on the left is one I bought from cvs, and the one on the right is the large one from amazon, and you can clearly see that they put hyaluronic acid lower on the list for the amazon one, vs the cvs one. And just in case you don't know, ingredients for any products go in order from the greatest amounts first, and descend to lower amounts as you go down the list. The cvs one has hyaluronic acid much higher on the list, and the packaging looks completely different too! Like, why?? Does cerave make a cheaper version of their products for amazon, vs other retailers?? And that is just really annoying, aggravating, and upsetting to me. Why water it down to buy it for a cheaper price? No one wants that. Everyone wants to get what they pay for. For sure, the one from cvs was much pricier ($17) for the smaller bottle size, while the amazon one was like, $12 when I got it for the large, 19 oz one. But I just want to say that I KNOW what I'm paying for!! If its a cheaper price for a more watered down product, I'm not going to get it!! Just leave the products the way that they are. And I have to say that yes, the textures between them were NOTICEABLY different! The one from cvs was definitely more opaque and creamier, while as soon as I got the amazon one, I immediately immediately noticed, without a doubt, a more watery consistency. Um, barf. Never going to buy this product from amazon again because of how they're so blatantly cheating! I'll just put my money in something else",2.0 out of 5 stars,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71jPQctKGsL.jpg,oily,oily_B07RK4HST7_pid0_0,https://www.amazon.com/CeraVe-Moisturizing-Lotion-Hyaluronic-Fragrance/dp/B07RK4HST7/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=B07RK4HST7&qid=1592511881&sr=8-1,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51YT4dO6bfL._SL1000_.jpg
1,1,B07RK4HST7,CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion | 19 Ounce | Face & Body Lotion for Dry Skin with Hyaluronic Acid | Fragrance Free,"Before i get into my novel of a review, here’s the summary of what i think. I came across this while looking for a lotion that works best for Non-oily skin, a daily lotion, for sensitive-ish skin, i found the PERFECT one with this.I bought this about 2 weeks ago, was shipped in 2 days, & when i received it nothing was wrong with the packaging or bottle. Anyways, I started using this after i decided to switch from my Neutrogena Oil-Free Moisture which i had been using for about 6 months. I do not have naturally Oily Skin so it was too drying. But with maaaaany hours spent looking for a FACE lotion with good reviews I came across this and let me just say IT IS WORTH THE MONEY, I am in love! works for face and body which i was skeptical about at first but i do not regret my purchase at all and i highly highly reccomend anyone purchase this. My skin is a little sensitive mainly to perfumes (especially my face) & this is amazing!!! no breakouts, no rash, I will use this forever!",5.0 out of 5 stars,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61k3CEXiieL.jpg,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/717C+cYz9OL.jpg,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71am8OWhOAL.jpg",oily,"oily_B07RK4HST7_pid1_0,oily_B07RK4HST7_pid1_1,oily_B07RK4HST7_pid1_2",https://www.amazon.com/CeraVe-Moisturizing-Lotion-Hyaluronic-Fragrance/dp/B07RK4HST7/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=B07RK4HST7&qid=1592511881&sr=8-1,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51YT4dO6bfL._SL1000_.jpg
2,2,B07RK4HST7,CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion | 19 Ounce | Face & Body Lotion for Dry Skin with Hyaluronic Acid | Fragrance Free,"My skin is relatively sensitive. Over the years I’ve gone through a number of lotions, searching for one that keeps my skin hydrated without any side effects (breakouts, rashes, etc). I’ve been using this daily moisturizer for a few weeks now and it’s worked out very well so far. I only have to apply once in the morning and my skin feels moisturized throughout the day. I guess that’s the hyaluronic acid doing it’s job.This lotion is lightweight and doesn’t leave me feeling greasy. It also doesn’t have much of a scent which I count as a plus. Best of all my skin isn’t breaking out or changing in any negative way.Although this product is touted as face and body lotion I have yet to use it on my face. That being said, it has worked very well for me as a go-to body lotion.",5.0 out of 5 stars,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71swolqQWZL.jpg,oily,oily_B07RK4HST7_pid2_0,https://www.amazon.com/CeraVe-Moisturizing-Lotion-Hyaluronic-Fragrance/dp/B07RK4HST7/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=B07RK4HST7&qid=1592511881&sr=8-1,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51YT4dO6bfL._SL1000_.jpg

5,5,B07RK4HST7,CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion | 19 Ounce | Face & Body Lotion for Dry Skin with Hyaluronic Acid | Fragrance Free,This is my absolute favorite moisturizer. It helps so much with dry patches during the winter time and even during the summer time it doesn't clog my pores or make you break out. It's such a great value I end up buying this versus the a.m. and p.m. because it's such a good value for the side and the money. I use this year round on my chest neck and face and I don't have any breakouts from it. I also love this because it's so easy to get and hardly ever out of stock.

The only other budget-friendly one was cerave and it was only SPF 15 and was the same price point as this one. So I bought this one and love it so far. It is super lightweight and rubs in completely matte (see photos). You can’t even tell you’re wearing sunscreen. I only needed about a dime size amount to cover my face and neck.

Even with lotion, I felt my face getting dry and getting way too oily. So I did my research, and it brought me to this product. I have used it for this week, and I am pretty pleased with the outcome. I use it twice a day. When I go to bed, and before I go to work, it's much lighter than lotion (not as thick). So it does a better job for me, not clogging up my pores, causing acne. It doesn't have a scent to it and smells like nothing. The ingredients on it are great, and they have aloe! My face seems to be doing much better and not getting as oily. Although this doesn't matter, I also love the design of the moisturizer. For me, it's aesthetically pleasing. I keep it on my sink counter because I love the all-white minimalistic look to it, which also works as a reminder for me to apply it to my face. All in all, I would rate it a 9/10.

I've tried many other moisturizers such as Olay Combination Skin Moisturizer (watery consistency, and greasy on my face causing breakouts), to high end products such as Shiseido and Lancome, none of which gave me the same smooth, matte, and oil controled skin as I get with this product. I started using it after digging through my ex-boyfriend's medicine cabinet one day when I ran out of my own moisturizer, and realized that it's the best kept skin secret I've yet to discover. I used to get small to medium-sized pimples weekly and monthly, uneven and red spots, and very oily T-zones. And I used to cover it up with lots of foundation or BB cream, which caused even more breakouts. Ever since using this product, I HAVE NOT FOUND THE NEED TO WEAR FOUNDATION OR BB CREAM FOR MONTHS!!! Yes that's right, I am so proud to tell people that I've stored away my foundation makeup and use less oil-absorbent sheets than before. I use this product everyday, morning and night time, never skipped once, because I would feel the differences right away and run straight to the bathroom to put it on. All of these are just the results that worked on me, and I hope it works for you as well, because having clearer skin has been truly one of the best gifts I've gotten.UPDATE: Still use this product to this day.

Unfortunately, the product fell flat for me in most aspects.At first, I liked the light consistency of the product.  The strong, rather unappealing scent did not reinforce my good first impression: it smelled like a cinnamon candy blended with something rather putrid.  I honestly held my breath when applying the moisturizer, hoping the smell would dissipate (it did, or I got used to it).The problem began when I applied the product.  My whole face turned light pink and stung a bit.  Because the stinging stopped after a minute or two, I did not remove the product from my face.Upon arriving at work, I glanced at my face in the rear view mirror of my car, and noticed my usual oily sheen appearing on my cheeks.  After teaching my first class, I went to the restroom and discovered my nose and cheeks were very red and inflamed; my nose was especially red and irritated (see photos).  I gently washed my face, but the redness (later accompanied by soreness) on my nose persisted for a couple days.I returned the product, since it caused such a negative reaction on my face.

85,85,B07D62CLYM,"LILY SADO Green Tea and Vitamin C Face Moisturizer Cream - Antioxidant, Anti-Wrinkle Natural Facial Moisturizing Lotion - Softens, Hydrates, Firms & Tones for Amazing, Radiant Skin. For Women & Men"," UPDATE: Just wanted to say again, how much I love this green tea and vitamin C cream; I did a video on it to share how much I love it.  As I write this updated review nearly a year later I still love this cream!  I live in Las Vegas and today? It's going to be 113 degress!! Also, do you know how DRY it is here in Vegas? Well? It's dry, I moved here 2 years ago and was used to the humidity in Austin, TX but now? I have to deal with dry skin :-( plus being older.  This cream really helps me stay moistuized AND it looks so natural on - some creams change your skin color (like you're wearing some sunscreen and you look greasy!) You can put this cream on and not look like you're in over a 100 degree heat yet? At the same time? Your skin does not look matte (for me this makes me look like my skin is flat or older) it has a nice slightly glowy look on you.  I  also love that when I'm using this cream, I am putting ALL NATURAL ingredients on - no more chemicals into my skin (remember, your skin is the BIGGEST) organ out ther.  There's also almost no smell to it and for the price? This cream is SO worth it!! It has proven to be my go to cream now and a little goes a long way.  Hope this updated review helped!So, I recently bought this cream because i love the natural ingredients - it smells amazing - especially if you like the smell of citrus!  It goes on smoothly and really hydrates. Note worthy: For those of you that like creams that make your skin look dewy (or greasy - depending on how you look at it) this cream is matte - meaning you do not look like you have cream on or as some would say - oily.  If you're skin is already kind of oily this cream would be really good for you because you do NOT shine when it's on :-) IF you have dry skin and are older (like me) it won't give you that slightly dewy look...but I feel my skin looks and feels amazing with it on. (See picture of me).  I'm turning 50 in November (2018) and I like the way my skin looks with this.I will say that the cream's bottle is not that big but it says clearly that it is 1.7 ounces - I would really like it if the company made the cream in a larger size.  The cream comes in a pump and you don't need a lot (dime to nickle size depending on your skin) for it to have an affect.Overall? Really nice cream, best for oily skin and all natural ingredients - I look forward to using it all up and purchasing more - you cannot beat the natural ingredients, decent price and anti-aging affect it has on your skin.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/716ObC2I43L.jpg,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71BCnLycHQL.jpg,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Z0xHLjxML.jpg,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71gEml6C8lL.jpg,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71jInuQMvNL.jpg",oily,"oily_B07D62CLYM_pid85_0,oily_B07D62CLYM_pid85_1,oily_B07D62CLYM_pid85_2,oily_B07D62CLYM_pid85_3,oily_B07D62CLYM_pid85_4",https://www.amazon.com/Green-Tea-Vitamin-Moisturizer-Face/dp/B07D62CLYM/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=B07D62CLYM&qid=1592512635&sr=8-1,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/719JS6iokEL._SL1500_.jpg

I don't need as much moisturizer and my skin feels much less tight.I also live in Las Vegas (aka the desert) and after spening 17 years in Texas (humid)- my skin has had to make an adjustment.

For Women & Men","This is a fabulous basic eye cream, which I found really gentle on my extremely sensitive skin. I apply about a pea-sized amount total to my eyes (lashline to brows) and the orbital/socket area, undereye and crow's feet. I have been using it morning and night for 4 weeks, and I do notice that my undereye seems more hydrated. No change in wrinkles but that really isn't to be expected with a topical product.I had an allergic reaction to another brand's moisturizer while using this, and this is a gentle enough cream that I could still use it while recovering. It didn't burn or sting my sensitive, peeling eyelids and I really appreciated that.I'm about a third of the way through the container and have been using it consistently for a month. Given that usage, I predict that I would need to replace every 3 months. That's a budget friendly option, though I would also like a larger container as mentioned by another commenter.Really great product.

It was not cheap but it did the job. Well they decided to reformulate it and put it in a smaller tube and although they said it was scent free still, It now seemed to have a more flowery oder which I did not care for. So I began searching for a new one and it lead me to this product. Been using it for about 3 months now and I would have to say I really like it. Has no odor, does not leave you with that shiny look and keeps my face nice and hydrated. Love the dispenser with its pump top. 3 pumps and I have the perfect amount for me. This should help the bottle last longer as each use is consistent. Seems to last awhile as well and the price is pretty good when comparing it to what I was using. Also I have had no issues with any kind of skin breakouts so it seems to be pretty friendly to that. Just a really nice gentle all around facial moisturizer.

After years of trial and error, on a magazine's suggestion, i went to my nearest Ulta and bought this baby and i am pleased. For starters, it has a pleasing, fresh scent and has a gel-like formula, as most moisturizers for oily skin, should be. It spreads easily and absorbs quickly into the skin. Just make sure to let it dry for a minute or two if you plan on applying makeup afterward.If you're planning on applying primer on top, make sure that it's one that has ingredients that correspond well with the ones in this moisturizer and your skin type. Pairing these products appropriately effects the longevity of your makeup. And having said that, i think it's important to add that this product DOES have Dimethicone in it, which is not listed in the ingredients list above. I'm not sure if this silicone is something they added recently, altering the product, but makeup users, especially, should be aware of this. Because of this, i do not add a silicone primer with it as i've found that it contributes to me becoming oily faster.One last thing i'll add is that if possible, it's MUCH better to get this in-store at an Ulta or drug-store than on here.

When I applied this product I was scared that it would leave a white film over my face but it didn’t. I DID HAVE TO WORK WITH IT THOUGH. Applying it initially does leave white streaks. Although, I learned that if I apply it on regularly and let it sit on my face for a few minutes, I could blend out those white streaks. I look crazy at first but it is blend-able. I don’t know if it’s good for a sunscreen to be blended out, so that is up to your interpretation. Also, I have no idea if this technique would work on darker skin than mine.Secondly, I have dry and sensitive skin. On my skin it looks “oily” or “shiny” or maybe even “dewy”, but I don’t mind because I rarely see my skin dewy. Also, my skin just sucks it right up after 15-20 minutes.

It made my skin soft and I don’t need to use a separate sunscreen so I’m quite satisfied with it. It came dermatologist recommended and it’s perfect for the winter time when my skin gets dry! The only thing I don’t like is it sometimes peels off when I apply it first under my makeup and I think it’s because of the sunscreen that’s in it.

You do not need a lot, and it dries quickly, gives your face a nice glow, but not shiny. It felt kinda refreshing putting it on after my face wash freshly washed. I never had any issues with my face drying out. Instead, it seemed to make my face even oilier and it definitely clogged my pores!!  I didn’t believe it was this neutralizer until after applying early one morning last week with a semi clear face, and later that evening my boyfriend came home and asked me if I had a rash!!  I looked in the bathroom mirror and my face was starting to break out all over my lower cheeks!  By the morning, I had little white heads all over my cheeks, forehead, chin, and even spots on my neck. When I washed my face off I could feel a slimy residue left behind from the moisturizer I applied the night before.

My chin is clear, my redness is gone. Works perfectlywith make up.  It doesn't build up. Twice a day and my skin feels incredible right away.  Seeing my skin like this gives me a huge incentive to work for a better routine. If I get a spot i use the clean and clear corrector. By the next morning it's mostly gone.

The caprylic triglyceride, among other ingredients, is no doubt the reason this has worked so great for me, bc it kills the candida topically.  Candida acne always has tiny dark (greenish?!👽) bumps that won't budge no matter what, like they're embedded in the skin; but guess what, after applying a thick layer of this product overnight, they came right off when I washed my face!But to back up, I used this product along with the era organics face wash for acne for four weeks and my cystic acne kept getting worse and more painful, but that's because I wasnt using it right!I would wash my face, let it sit for 30 sec, and then put on the moisturizer, gently rubbing it in till there were no more white streaks.  The cysts all over my face were so painful that it hurt to rub the moisturizer in, and i was pretty disappointed that I wasnt getting results like other reviewers.Then I noticed that the face wash was 3/4 gone and the moisturizer was only half gone; and the lightbulb went off, maybe I'm not using enough moisturizer! So I started applying moisturizer generously so that there were still white streaks all over my face. On top of that, I used a cotton swab to completely cover each zit and cyst with the moisturizer, and then just left it, all night and all day (I work from home). Most of it absorbs into the skin, leaving just the extra on each blemish visible, as in pics.On day two of this routine, I was shocked that the biggest cyst was reduced in size by half... Was previously .5in diameter and stuck off face a quarter inch, no joke.Other things I did to help my face during these 4 days wasleave face wash on face longer before washing off, i.e., 1 min instead of 30 sec.cut out almost all sugar and alsoquit using toner that had alcohol...I switched to thayers brand toner which noticeablely improved redness and inflammation from the acne overnight.Apply bentonite clay mask to cysts every other day (cyst busting mask secret is to mix bentonite clay with organic coconut oil, it really does reduce the cyst and calm it down).Wash face once a day, my skin is too sensitive for twice a day.Pics are from day 4 of this routine, I can't believe how nice my skin is in less than a wk. I used to have tiny itchy bumps e.v.e.r.w.h.e.r.e., and big honking cysts that were fire engine red... they're now on the way out, thanks to the generous application of this product!

When I use this product I can tell the difference between a moisturizer made with natural ingredients, and one that is made up of chemicals with names I don't even know. My skin soaks up this moisturizer really well and just a little bit leaves my face feeling smooth, not oily, and not too dry.The downside for me - pricey for a small container. That's how it is buying organic products most of the time, but I think it is worth it. Considering it really only takes a small amount to work, for one person it should last a while.

I am already getting compliments that there is something different about my face. It gives the appearance that my face is a little younger that it actually is which has really been a confidence booster for me. Getting a few compliments that people think I don’t even look nearly forty bout early thirties. Once girl thought I was in my late twenties. Very light weight product. No smell. I don’t have a greasy face at the end of the day and hasn’t caused any breaking out. Pores appear shrunk and smaller.

I saw that it was well reviewed so I decided to give it a try. Sometimes products have fake reviews but I saw that the wash is made with quality ingredients so I gave it a go. When I received the face wash I compared it to the face wash I have been using for the last year.I was really happy to see that the Brickell Face Wash has less ingredient and every ingredient is clarified in layman’s terms. For example, the first few ingredients are Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Leaf Juice), Aspalathus Linearis (Rooiboos), and Olea Europaea (Olive Oil). I was also happy to see that most (if not all) of the ingredients are natural.The scent of the face wash is so pleasant—almost tea like—and it does not overwhelm or smell chemical-y like my previous wash. I love that the wash is light and easy to squeeze out so I don’t end up wasting or trying to put it back. It’s nice that they also offer unscented for those who are scent-sensitive.I decided to research Brickell further and I was ecstatic to see that a sample kit of all of the products is offered for free. The kit arrived fairly  quickly and some of the samples ended up lasting a really long time!I am really happy that I discovered Brickell products and I recommend it to my guy friends (and even some of my girl friends that prefer male-branded products). I definitely recommend checking out the website and giving the sample kit a try. Brickell has made me more interested in skin care and being mindful about what I put on my body.I have sensitive skin so not every product works for me. I have definitely noticed that my skin has improved since I started using Brickell and I feel confident that it will stay this way.

I have oily combo skin. After I wash my face, my skin is so dry and tight for awhile before the oil slick comes in my t-zone areas.When I got this, I noticed it is a little harder to pump out than a normal moisturizer, and it comes out a little thick. The smell is slightly unusual, but it’s just a combo of the natural ingredients without all the chemical perfumes, so you have to get used to the texture and smell, neither are “bad” at all, but they are different.  You also have to be sure you put just the right amount on, too little and it won’t spread out, too thick and it will just stay on top of skin and not absorb.All that being said, I’ve noticed a BIG improvement in my skin since I started using this product. My skin seems less oily, more even toned, less irritated, less red, more calm, and less acne prone. I’m not an all natural hippie chick by any means, but this product is making me re-think that. Maybe it’s about time I started using more natural products like this to improve my skin. I really like this stuff and it has improved my skin a lot.

For one, the company donates one can of food to a food bank with each product purchase (I didn’t know that when I ordered). Why else did I like it? The container that dispenses the product is a type that does not allow air inside, so the product has a longer shelf life and stays clean and sterile- very important for someone with sensitive skin. The container and lid are good ones for traveling with- it won’t get pushed down inside my luggage and come out inside my bag. There’s more? Yes! The sunscreen smells amazing. The cucumber scent has an earthy, plant-based tinge to it, which I love! My nose can tell that this product is all-natural as the company claims! The product soothes my irritated skin. And?? It doesn’t leave a pasty film on my face. Some mineral sunscreens’ protective barriers have made me appear washed out and pale. Jivi sunscreen doesn’t! I purchased the spf12 sunscreen. It isn’t a high spf, because I wanted this to be the “everyday” sunscreen I use on the days when I’ll be indoors all day. (I use a higher spf when I know I’ll be outdoors.) ANYHOW, this was a long review, I know. That’s only because I want more people to be aware of this fabulous product and ethical company!  I want this company to be going strong years from now, because I will definitely be a lifelong customer. Jivi, you left quite an impression!!!

After a couple weeks of using it, off & on, I fell in love with it!It's Organic & Cruelty Free, which are things I truly value.It has a beautiful Lavendar scent, not too strong but, enough to notice. The color of the moisturizer is pale green, which I'm assuming has to do with the micro algae.I have combination skin; some areas get oily throughout the day & some areas stay dry. This moisturizer has worked well for me in both areas. No excess oil at the end of the day like some moisturizers do.I apply after I wash my face in the morning & in the evenings. I smooth small dabs all over my face & neck. It's also been a great ""primer"" before applying my makeup.Unfortunately, in my early 30's, I still get small breakouts here & there. So, I started using a small dab of Jivi on the blemish before bed & in the morning the blemish has calmed down quite a bit where I can smoothly cover it with makeup.My only Con for this moisturizer; it's only an SPF 12.  We all know that's not going to do much of anything. I really hope Jivi can eventually make that a much larger number sometime in the future.All I all, I really enjoy Jivi & I am willing to give their other products a try!Their prices seem very reasonable & I will be repurchasing soon!I think they are a lovely brand & I especially like that with each purchase, they donate a meal to Feeding America!",4.0 out of 5 stars,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61yA5fDzlZL.jpg,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/715L4ItMwSL.jpg,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71BBdTe1ySL.jpg,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Ii6NHpAvL.jpg,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81e7LJFvJOL.jpg,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91m4mIbqV2L.jpg",oily,"oily_B074ZHMMD4_pid382_0,oily_B074ZHMMD4_pid382_1,oily_B074ZHMMD4_pid382_2,oily_B074ZHMMD4_pid382_3,oily_B074ZHMMD4_pid382_4,oily_B074ZHMMD4_pid382_5",https://www.amazon.com/Jivi-Moisturizer-Protection-Reducing-Cucumber/dp/B074ZHMMD4/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=B074ZHMMD4&qid=1592513833&sr=8-1,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51JGtJxdt0L._SL1300_.jpg

This is literally my favorite facial moisturizing cream. My face is very sensitive, anything that is too heavy makes me break out and also makes my face sweat excessively. So most everything else I try just is way too heavy for my face. But this is really light and is practically the only moisturizer I can use that doesn't make me break out or make me sweat after applying it. It also does a great job of moisturizing and makes my face feel really soft and fresh. This is not greasy at all. The texture is like a cool gel and a little goes a long way.

394,394,B000YJ2SLG,CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion | 12 Ounce | Face & Body Lotion for Dry Skin with Hyaluronic Acid | Fragrance Free,"Just want to let everyone know that the cerave lotion on the left is one I bought from cvs, and the one on the right is the large one from amazon, and you can clearly see that they put hyaluronic acid lower on the list for the amazon one, vs the cvs one. And just in case you don't know, ingredients for any products go in order from the greatest amounts first, and descend to lower amounts as you go down the list. The cvs one has hyaluronic acid much higher on the list, and the packaging looks completely different too! Like, why?? Does cerave make a cheaper version of their products for amazon, vs other retailers?? And that is just really annoying, aggravating, and upsetting to me. Why water it down to buy it for a cheaper price? No one wants that. Everyone wants to get what they pay for. For sure, the one from cvs was much pricier ($17) for the smaller bottle size, while the amazon one was like, $12 when I got it for the large, 19 oz one. But I just want to say that I KNOW what I'm paying for!! If its a cheaper price for a more watered down product, I'm not going to get it!! Just leave the products the way that they are. And I have to say that yes, the textures between them were NOTICEABLY different! The one from cvs was definitely more opaque and creamier, while as soon as I got the amazon one, I immediately immediately noticed, without a doubt, a more watery consistency. Um, barf. Never going to buy this product from amazon again because of how they're so blatantly cheating!

I came across this while looking for a lotion that works best for Non-oily skin, a daily lotion, for sensitive-ish skin, i found the PERFECT one with this.I bought this about 2 weeks ago, was shipped in 2 days, & when i received it nothing was wrong with the packaging or bottle. Anyways, I started using this after i decided to switch from my Neutrogena Oil-Free Moisture which i had been using for about 6 months. I do not have naturally Oily Skin so it was too drying. But with maaaaany hours spent looking for a FACE lotion with good reviews I came across this and let me just say IT IS WORTH THE MONEY, I am in love! works for face and body which i was skeptical about at first but i do not regret my purchase at all and i highly highly reccomend anyone purchase this.

482,482,B077TQR6ZW,CeraVe Face Moisturizer with SPF 30 | 1.7 Ounce | Light-Weight Face Lotion with Hyaluronic Acid | Packaging May Vary,"I LOVE this face lotion - it's great for my [very] oily skin because it's so light and mattifying yet provides SPF 30. For anyone with greasy skin who is looking for a great product with spf they can wear under their makeup every day without looking like their face is dripping wet by noon (due to oiliness), PLEASE GIVE THIS LOTION A TRY! You won't regret it. Make sure you purchase the ""Ultra Light Moisturizer for Normal to Oily Skin"" in the 1.7 oz bottle. CeraVe makes a myriad of face lotions and this one is absolutely incredible. Living (and aging) in Southern California, I've been on a 10 year-long mission to find the perfect balance of a non-greasy face lotion with great SPF coverage that I can use daily, either alone or under makeup. I was randomly given a sample of this and I cannot put into words how amazed I was after the first day of use. I still need my oil blotters throughout the day, but my face doesn't feel like it has a 1-inch layer of Crisco on its surface after being at work for less than an hour.Also, a heads-up to anyone scrolling through these reviews: I've noticed some 1-star comments, however after seeing the specific bottle size and product name at the top of each comment, I soon came to realize that about half of the comments for this product (the ""Ultra Light Moisturizer for Normal to Oily Skin SPf 30"" are erroneously referring to various other CeraVe face lotions - many are referring to the ""CeraVe AM face lotion"" or the ""CeraVe PM face lotion,"" both of which come in a 3 oz bottle and shouldn't be confused with the ""Ultra Light Moisturizer for Normal to Oily skin, 30 SPF - 1.7 oz bottle"" lotion. It's kind of a bummer because this product would probably have a much higher star rating if so many folks hadn't written poor reviews for the wrong items on this product's page. So if you're trying to get a good understanding of THIS product, please disregard all of the reviews for the ""CeraVe AM (or PM) Lotion, 3-oz,"" since those are both completely different face moisturizers from what this comment section is supposed to be about. I even saw photos of the wrong lotion type in the section where people are supposed to post pictures of the product being reviewed. I'm including a picture of the CORRECT product; hopefully that will help lessen any confusion. Sorry for the rant but I just wanted to point this problem out - I was surprised to see any poor reviews and then realized the customers writing about bad experiences were often complaining about a totally different lotion than the product at hand.I have tried (and been disappointed by) so many SPF face lotions - expensive brands, inexpensive brands, and everything in between. Once I found this heavenly product, I was truly elated. It's great for oily skin and feels so light and nourishing - my skin always feels smooth and soft after applying it.It's also much less expensive on Amazon - I was at CVS last night and they are charging about $7 more per bottle. I love Amazon and I love this product. Protecting your skin from the sun on a daily basis is very important and should be a priority for everyone. This is a wonderful, high-quality SPF moisturizer and you should definitely give it a try.

Other reviewers didn’t seem to have that problem so I’m not sure why I do - I usually apply shortly after showering so I know my skin is clean, but still leaves it sticky.

I'm in my late 20's and I was diagnosed with ""pre-rosacea"" - a mild redness to my cheeks and jawline, but none of the other symptoms such as acne. My skin looked and felt chronically dry to the point of itching no matter what I used. My skin was like, perpetually chapped. I tried everything: dandruff shampoo (for the selenium), zinc/sulphur soap (anti-bacterial), sea buckthorn oil, primrose oil, hemp oil, maracuja oil (anti-inflammatory), and azelaic acid (finacea). Nothing worked and if anything they all just exacerbated the problem.Enter niacinamide aka B3 aka the miracle ingredient that not only has anti-aging properties but, as it turns out, the ability to ""address skin discolorations"". Yeeeeah, you can side-eye that description if you want, I too am tired of reading about how blahblah ingredient calms redness or is an anti-inflammatory (anti-inflammatory for me=run for the hills because you're about to get a big old dose of RED)  But no, niacinamide has bigger plans than that. It is a 'cell communicating' ingredient that basically tells your well-meaning but crappier skin cells ""hey, wake up and behave like you care a little"". You know how when you first wake up your skin is clear and beautiful and ohmygod I-am-having-the-best-skin day ever, til you actually stand up and start moving around and then BAM it's like you ran hot water on your face except it never goes away? This product actually somehow maintains that morning skin for me, all the time. Additionally the texture has improved and it finally feels hydrated.

I found this thanks to Paula Begoun, cosmetic / skincare guru (CHECK HER OUT!) when I needed a moisturizer for my acne-prone yet dry, sensitive skin.  I also needed something I could purchase locally without spending an arm and a leg (I am NOT the dept. store / whole entire skincare line/ fancy product type).  It's not as cheap as some options but I'll tell you what, it's money VERY well spent.  This, along with clean and clear's foaming wash for sens. skin and a washcloth (don't underestimate it's power) comprises my entire skincare routine and I couldn't be happier.  I have hardly had a blemish since and I don't suffer from dryness like I used to.  Need I say more?I use it once a day, when I wash my face at night (either in the shower or at the sink) and it goes on super smooth and absorbs well.  Sometimes, esp. when the weather's really dry, I use it in the morning too (so go ahead and disregard that PM in the title - I think it's just because it doesn't have a sunscreen component).  I also appreciate that it works so well that my skin no longer feels 'tight' and painful after a shower pre-moisturizer - that to me is a sign it's working at a deeper level.  No stinging, no residue, just healthy skin.  Plus, while the best price is usually thru Subscribe and Save I like that if I'm ever in a pickle (ie -out of town) I can find it at a local drugstore and remain on a regimen that works so well for me.",5.0 out of 5 stars,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/714NURiIyFL.jpg,oily,oily_B00365DABC_pid548_0,https://www.amazon.com/CeraVe-Facial-Moisturizing-Lotion-Lightweight/dp/B00365DABC/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=B00365DABC&qid=1592515210&sr=8-1,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51aoiMUlahL._SL1000_.jpg

I was wrong. i've been using it for 3 days and my skin feels awful, there is nothing hydrated feeling about it. My skin feels dry, and honestly hurts.

The time frame was about a year. Keep in mind too, I've had one heck of a year. It has tried to age me even more, but I think the results are in favor of Olay. I think my entire neck, especially the area at the base has had the biggest improvement. Also, the wrinkles around my mouth have improved.I apply this in the morning and before bedtime (to be honest, sometimes I don't get to it at night. I also don't wear any makeup). Every day I also use a 2.5% Retinol serum and 100SPF sunscreen. I have found that just smoothing in the Olay cream doesn't allow it to fully absorb into my skin. It'll also ""ball up"" if I rub my face. I started wetting my fingertips a couple of times to smooth it in. Possibly that's why it has worked so well for me???I would wholeheartedly recommend to everyone trying to diminish wrinkles to try this out.

578,578,B0012J30LY,"Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream, Face Moisturizer with Hyaluronic Acid & Vitamin B3+, 1.7 oz","I was exceedingly skeptical about purchasing a face product not made organically. I use only edible grade oils as everything else makes my rosacea go out-of-control. But I am in my mid-thirties now, it's cold, and my oils were not cutting it. This is my 4th product, Eclos being the first (works well but difficult to find), No. & (rosacea did NOT like), and Boot's Botanics (horrid smelling and rosacea irritating), then this stuff. The Regenerist system is wonderful. I use oil to remove my makeup, the cream cleanser to deep clean, then the serum and the cream. The latter I use in the morning and evening. My skin is silky and moisturized, and my fine lines have disappeared (I do not have any deep lines yet, so I can't speak to those). Most exciting (and unanticipated) is that my rosacea has improved after 1 week's use, the redness and sensitivity is nearly gone, which is a miracle during the winter months. It is much pricier than making all my own stuff, but well worth it for the fantastic results. I have two photos, one is a typical my-face shot, and the other (the one that insists on being effing sideways, sorry) is after a week's use. The difference in redness on my face and the texture of my skin is pretty cool, and both pictures are without filters/makeup. I hope this review helps someone!

It glides on smooth, effortless, and maintains a beautiful consistency. It has a lightweight formula that doesn't overpower the senses, leave my sensitive skin feeling stripped, inflamed or irritated. It's a product that I felt, on my 'quick days' to smooth on without fear of it causing a rash, or not hold-up in one of the rushed days where you're barely getting out of the door. Perfumed formulas immediately break me out, but this has nothing of the sort, and it's a pleasant experience over all.I am noticing weekly improvements and skin softening overtime, that hadn't been there before.

600,600,B07BB3FK19,Korean Skin Care Snail Repair Cream - Korean Moisturizer Night Cream 97.5% Snail Mucin Extract - All In One Recovery Power For The Most Effective Korean Beauty Routine - 2oz,"To start, I have dry, ridiculously picky skin that does not take to many moisturizers.  Most moisturizers will sit on the top of my thirsty skin and dry to gross, leftover flakes.  This was a completely different experience for me, and I've been thoroughly impressed with this whole skin care line so far.Back to the product... The smell when you open the jar is delicious.  It hit my nose right away; citrusy, and fresh.  The consistency of this cream is also just right.  This is not thick and cakey, and applies smooth without burning or irritation.  It goes on a little greasy looking, which was unexpected for me, but weirdly enough I like.  Applying it also leaves a shine finish on the skin for a while.  That said, the moisturizer did absorb for me, and I love the way it leaves my skin dewy and actually, for once, moisturized!If you are prone to perspiration in the summer months, as I am, this will melt off a bit. Even when it does, my skin feels hydrated and protected.  I've never had that before.I feel like this is a pretty standard sized glass tub and looks enough product to last for a few months.  Right now, it's working well with an essence and serum.  This is my new holy grail moisturizer!I have a few pictures attached so you can see the size of the jar in comparison to some normal tweezers, as well as the color and consistency of the product.  My glass jar came with a seal that said don't use if broken. The label states this cream is cruelty free, and the canister is recyclable.

I heard a lot of good things about this brand already so it was an easy decision.I have acne-prone, sensitive, oily (but extremly dry on some areas on my face) skin, so it is hard to find products that are just right for me.This cream was delivered in a decent condition, the box was clean and with no damage, but one thing not really satisfying is the tube was not sealed.It has very creamy texture, not watery at all, as you can see in the pictures I’ve attached.And the size of the product is actually bigger than I thought it would be-attached a picture of it next to Aveeno hand cream to compare the size.When I tried it on my face, there was no irritation at all, no burning or stinging feelings.It is not greasy at all, but still moisturizing enough that I can feel it right after one application.I am very satisfied with this purchase, and willing to buy another one after this.I’m so happy that I ordered it to use for the cold and dry weather we are having.I highly recommend this facial moisturizer for anybody who is looking for one that is not too overwhelming but still moisturizing enough :)",5.0 out of 5 stars,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Hr05eNPrL.jpg,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71RA6ObLM-L.jpg,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/813jrD80KXL.jpg",oily,"oily_B01N9SPQHQ_pid646_0,oily_B01N9SPQHQ_pid646_1,oily_B01N9SPQHQ_pid646_2",https://www.amazon.com/Roche-Posay-Toleriane-Double-Repair-Moisturizer/dp/B01N9SPQHQ/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=B01N9SPQHQ&qid=1592515683&sr=8-1,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61KrAOXvVDL._SL1200_.jpg

I’m pacing Walgreens skin care aisle, reading labels up & down. Sweaty & hormonal, pregnant & confused.There she was; the esthetician angel hired by Walgreens. She approaches me.“How can I help you?” I look at her, she looks at me. She must be in her 60s? But her skin looks flawless. (Seriously do pores just disappear at her age?) She doesn’t even have wrinkles, except for some beautifully placed smile lines.“Sure,” I mumble; clearly disheartened. “My face is freaking out. I’ve spent $100+ these last few months trying to fix it. I’ve never had an issue-before this pregnancy- & I don’t know what’s wrong with my skin!” I continue to vent hormonally, “Breaking out, greasy one moment & dry & flaky the next-“She nods her head up & down as I speak, eyes shimmering in understanding behind her rimless glasses. She’s been here before.“Have you tried La Roche moisturizer? It’s probiotic thermal water works miracles.”I haven’t of course.My fairy godmother (for who else could this angel be?) hands me the unsuspecting bottle. $20 dollars? I scoff inwardly at the high price tag, not fully understanding yet what a gift this is.SPF or no spf? (It doesn’t matter I later find out, they both were made by the beautiful witches of the west & represent it.)It worked that very night. My face literally healed in 24 hours. (Read the back of the bottle. It does what it says)18 months later, I’m on my 5th bottle. My face is supple, even, and I barely wear makeup. (cc cream by it, & that’s it.)It’s magical.

671,671,B0071XPQQ2,"CeraVe SA Lotion for Rough & Bumpy Skin | 8 Ounce | Vitamin D, Hyaluronic Acid, Salicylic Acid & Lactic Acid Lotion | Fragrance Free","After having tried both Cerave and Amlactin, which are not identical products, but seem like they're basically built to do the same thing, I can say that Cerave is the hand's down winner for a variety of reasons.  Despite the fact that it takes longer to see results, Cerave wins due to texture, scent, and overall feel.  I tried really hard to like Amlactin for over a year, but it feels and smells gross compared to Cerave.SKIN SMOOTHING POWER:  Cerave takes a little longer to see results, but there is less irritation.  With Amlactin, I would frequently get itchy, and sometimes get tiny irritated bumps, which were not acne, but could resemble bad skin if scratched.  If you have severe KP, you might want to try both, and even alternate them, but I could not be happier to ditch the Amlactin, so I'll take slow progress over gross feel and smell.SCENT:  Cerave is truly odorless.  In comparison, Amlactin smells sour, and the bad smell lingers for at least an hour or two depending on how much you use.  Not great if you need to use it on your face!  But Cerave has no scent whatsoever.  I can use it on my face and under makeup without issues.TEXTURE:  Cerave and Amlactin appear to have the same pudding-like texture, but Cerave is easier to apply, because it sinks in quicker.  Amlactin leaves skin greasy.  If you applied Amlactin to your feet, you wouldnt be able to walk across a hardwood floor for at least 15-20 minutes unless you put socks/slippers on.MOISTURIZING POWER:  Amlactin in the winner if you are looking for heavy moisture.  But Cerave is the winner if you want clean-feeling moisture.  After applying Cerave, my skin feels lightly hydrated, but then again I don't have extremely dry skin, just skin that fails to slough off nicely.  Since I am oily on my face, I prefer Cerave, because it doesnt make my face feel unpleasantly greasy.PRICE:  Both Amlactin and Cerave work out to be about the same price for the same amount of product.  They both range from $12-15 for an 8oz bottle, so if you can get either one for under $13, you are getting a decent price.BOTTOM LINE:  If moisture is your top priority, and you can stand the gross smell and feel, Amlactin is still worth checking out for KP sufferers.  But if you value clean moisture and a light feeling on the skin, and are willing to wait a little longer for results, Cerave is much, much easier to bear, in my opinion.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/5123ckDemaL.jpg,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51GAIt3eSNL.jpg,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51ic0kH-LyL.jpg",oily,"oily_B0071XPQQ2_pid671_0,oily_B0071XPQQ2_pid671_1,oily_B0071XPQQ2_pid671_2",https://www.amazon.com/CeraVe-Renewing-Lotion-Ounce-Salicylic/dp/B0071XPQQ2/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=B0071XPQQ2&qid=1592516149&sr=8-1,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51u-DDxVNKL._SL1000_.jpg

I need something that moisturizes well so that my skin doesn’t produce as much oil to clog my pores. So these fairly dry sunscreen products don’t tend to work well for me.

They are fading but my skin is so sensitive to everything now. I love Eucerin body lotion and saw this cream with a promotional coupon on the page so I got it. (If this review comes up as an unverified purchase, it is because I used the coupon on the product page.) I have so many creams but this one says it is for sensitive skin and I do like the brand.I like it! It really softens my skin, doesn't pill or roll off, and is nice and thick. It is a yellow color (which isn't necessary but whatever) and it has no scent that I can discern. Very rich, a little goes a long way. My doctor said it is fine to use this cream on the areas where my shingles were since they are a month old and not open wounds. They look like they may scar so I am hoping the hydration helps them to lighten up. I also use Pacific Resources International Manuka Honey 10+ on the spots because it is antibacterial and heals wounds.I have very high end creams but I like this quite well. Enough to purchase again. It was only about $5.00 with the coupon but it is still very inexpressive full price. Definitely good for sensitive skin and for those who have really dry skin and like thicker creams.

I have noticed a huge difference in my face. It is much softer and moisturized. For best results, put this product on after the shower or after washing your face with water to slow down transepidermal water loss and hydrate your skin.What is great about this product is that it contains hyaluronic acid in the form of sodium hyaluronate. Hyaluronate is a glycosaminoglycan, which means it is a carbohydrate composed of repeating disaccharide units and contains an amino sugar (a sugar with a nitrogen). Hyaluronic acid is found all over the body in various tissues and serves as an important part of lubrication for tissues. In the skin, it is involved in tissue repair. Along with ceramides, which belong to the lipid family, hyaluronate is a great ingredient for hydrating your skin.I am a normal to oily skin type and find that this product is good for me as well. This product and products similar to it are definitely not only for dry skin types (or extra-dry skin types, as the label advertises), they are great for all skin types. For people with normal to oily skin, hydrating your face properly can actually contribute to less oily skin because your face is not producing oil in response to dryness. Keep in mind it is also important to use good sunscreen every day to protect your skin.This product is also great because it is unscented, which is best for skin care. It also non-comedogenic meaning it will not clog pores (good for oily skin types as well). Though the jar appears small, I have found it lasts quite along time,  because you only need a small amount to really hydrate your face. So, use length will really only depend on how many times a day you use it because you do not need much every time. I am totally converted and will continue to use this product or other products containing hyaluronic acid.Feb 10 2020 ***Updated to add***: I still enjoy this product. If you are using this as a moisturizer after getting your face wet (like after the shower or washing your face with water), I also recommend putting on a more occlusive (blocking, sealing) moisturizer on after this one, to seal in the water and hyaluronic good stuff. It depends on what works for your skin type but in the way of occlusive moisturizers I have enjoyed Aveeno's daily with oatmeal (they have several types), CeraVe daily, and LRP Lipikar baume AP+.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61ENLSkDHCL.jpg,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61sj-M0ITLL.jpg",oily,"oily_B00NR1YQK4_pid721_0,oily_B00NR1YQK4_pid721_1",https://www.amazon.com/Neutrogena-Hyaluronic-Hydrating-Moisturizer-Gel-Cream/dp/B00NR1YQK4/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=B00NR1YQK4&qid=1592516360&sr=8-1,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81wNmR0dB8L._SL1500_.jpg

It's not just for what it says it is - the hydrophilic hyaluronic acid that absorbs up to 1000x its weight.It's what it does.It's the way my skin feels after I put it on. I wash, blot but leave a touch of water on my face, then take a little on my finger - let it mix with that residual moisture. All over my face, eyelids (close them tight) and neck.I know I did it right when I get that enjoyable tingle - and an indescribable feeling that my skin feels pleasantly tighter - supple - like it's refreshed and awake. Like it's been given a healing balm.I use it nightly. Within a couple of days the difference was visible. That redness and flaking was gone. My face and neck felt - healthy. Good.

I myself suffer from severe eczema which doesn't have a calendar; it's like a volcano (only wakes when it wants to and is extremely grouchy when it does).  Having said that, this product was  selected because it has  ingredients which are nature derived and really, I wanted to try something that would help alleviate the symptoms, badly. The product is moisturizing when applied to my healthy skin; however, when I tried it on the eczematic skin (which didn't have broken skin, just raised, angry bumps) it actually made that area more angry.  I tried it 2x a day, for two weeks to see if the burning sensation would subside but each time, it burned and so I had to stop using it for my eczematic skin.  I don't blame the product, it's just that it didn't work for me, hence, the 4 stars.

I have just crested the high side of mid-40s and really wanted to find a good daily sun protectant to guard against [further] aging. This was so well-reviewed, I chose it over the next closest contenders, Roche-Posay products (which I usually love).Unfortunately, the first week of using it, I began to get tiny bumps on my face (not visible to the naked eye, but easily perceived with fingertips when washing or applying moisturizer). I had also been using a new 'flavor' of body lotion, so I went back to my basic tried-and-true products to let everything calm down for a bit, and try to definitively eliminate the culprit.After two weeks, I again applied this on two successive days when I'd be out in the sun for an extended period. On Day 1, once I'd gotten outside and had started perspiring, my neck began burning, then itching maddeningly -- I was only outside in my yard gardening, so ran inside and I washed it thoroughly off my neck.  My face seemed okay, so I left it there, and applied the product again to my ears and face (no neck) on Day 2 when heading out for a long weekend walk.This time, again once I'd gotten outside and started perspiring, the product started burning and itching around my eyebrows and general eye area.  I washed it off as best I could at the next public water fountain.The next day, I began to show itchy, painful swollen patches on my face, ears, and throat (the latter pictured as best I could, but it was difficult to shoot an area I couldn't see!)  This time, there had been no other 'new to me' product used, nor was there anything else that I carefully applied to ears/face/throat, all areas that then became rashy....So alas, not a product I can use, and alas for the waste of a significant amount of money. >:/  I've used other physical sunscreens in the past (eg Badger) without any issues, so it must be some substance in the cream besides that causing the problem.",1.0 out of 5 stars,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71LDvZmtP7L.jpg,oily,oily_B002MSN3QQ_pid766_0,https://www.amazon.com/EltaMD-Clear-Facial-Sunscreen-Broad-Spectrum/dp/B002MSN3QQ/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=B002MSN3QQ&qid=1592516555&sr=8-1,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51h245fcaSL._SL1296_.jpg

I put it on under my skincare and under my makeup. It comes in a small plastic bottle with a pump. It comes out as a thick white liquid, about the consistency of a moisturizer.This is what I can share about the product.Pros:- Does what it is made to do.- Light scent, not overpowering sunscreen smell. Still scented though.- Does not leave skin oily.- Does not cause breakouts for acne-prone skin.- Does not cause makeup to come off, as it does not dry down to be oily.Cons:- The amount of product you get versus the amount of product you get. The bottle is quite small.- It does have a very very slight white cast to it.

Product is either used or damaged during shipment, although I believe it can't be the latter since the cap is undamaged. I would return it if i didnt need this sunscreen today.Product:Now let's talk about the fun part: Elta MD's clear sunscreen with niacinamide! If you're acne-prone or have acne marks/hyperpigmentation you want niacinamide on your face. Unless of course your face doesn't like it (patch test just in case).Acne marks/hyperpigmentation on your skin grow darker in the sun. This product protects you from the sun AND lightens the mark as you wear it! Niacinamide is MAGIC.Application:If you have very oily/normal skin, I suggest applying this on a bare face. If you have any dry patches or your skin is tight (like me) moisturize first and let that sink in. Now you can put EltaMD clear on. Wait 15 mins before applying your makeup. Be gentler than usual when you apply your makeup so the sunscreen stays in place.*2hrs later*As you've probably read before, sunscreen needs to be reapplied throughout the day. With this sunscreen it's easy to reapply with your makeup on. When it's time to reapply I first press drops of grapeseed oil on dry patches on my skin and let that sink in.

I’ve been using retinol for about 15 years, used to get a prescription for it. But insurance doesn’t cover anymore , and it would cost $500 to refill. This product is inexpensive and really works. You only need to apply a small amount to areas where there are fine lines. If you apply every day all over face, it will get red and dry out! I know it works because I applied to my fine lines around lips/eyes/forehead and could see it disappear. I mix it with my face moisturizer.

835,835,B00SNPCSUY,CeraVe Night Cream for Face | 1.7 Ounce | Skin Renewing Night Cream with Hyaluronic Acid & Niacinamide | Packaging May Vary,"I have been using this miracle pot since last year.Let's start off with the moisturizing quality of CeRave  Night Cream; the pictures I uploaded show me facing the front of my living room window with natural lighting. There is a little bit of ""shine"" on the sides of my forehead (where I tend to apply some highlighting makeup anyway), but to wake up to this kind of glow on my face first thing in the morning? You BET I took a selfie and sent it to any friend who cared! When I smiled, there is no resistance on my face, meaning my skin is WELL-moisturized! I mention this because for some of my other regular face cream (even when it isn't for night time) the moisture would be gone by morning. And that's another thing I wanted to mention to you all: THIS CREAM goes a long way even with a very small amount that you apply on your fingers-- all the better, too, because the formula works to keep your face moisturized and healing all through the night. And what I mean by ""healing"" is restoring the balance of the moisture on your face to a supple condition. Because CeRave night cream has Hyaluronic acid which gives it that precise effect since hyaluronic acid pulls in moisture from your environment.For sensitive skin, I have no true review for it because my skin is not sensitive. I have oily skin but tend to suffer from overdrying. For me this occurs because I like to wash my face in the morning as well as in the night time (which is regular for many people, especially those that wear makeup). For my skin type, I've found that CeRave works very well with it. I really appreciate their AM moisturizer with the SPF because it has no oil in it, so it goes on without the ""greasy"" feel.The reason why I'm giving this product  A 5-STAR rating for its scent is because THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO SCENT! WHAT? YES, PLEASE! It is not always okay to rely on a moisturizer that is scented because it takes other formulas to be added into it, which may then irritate the skin. CeRave did a great job leaving this unscented, I love it. The only things I could wish for when it comes to this product is a bigger size, maybe, since this pot DOES feel a little small when holding it in your hand. But for the amount of benefits your skin will get from this, and like I said, a little goes a long way-- it can actually last a long time. For me it lasts a good 3-4 months.And you know what?

I tried Proactive, Oral Medications (I can't use many medical grade topical solutions as I have extremely sensitive skin and a ton of topical allergies to may medical grade cream bases), I tried several other acne washes too but I am allergic to pine sterols which end up in a lot of OC products. My dad, did some research for me one day when I called home crying because my face hurt too much to even put my face on my pillow to sleep. He found a few blog post about this product helping other young adults with medication caused acne and sent this to me overnight. I shit you not it cleared up ALL my acne, cystic included, almost completely in 6 weeks, and in 2 months my face was completely clear.I've been using this for 2 years now, and it has honestly saved me.

The best thing about this product is that it is effective at treating the pimple without drying the skin around it. I much prefer it over Burt's Bees blemish stick. I find that one to be less effective and more drying. However, I do like the little roll on bottle better for easy application. The bottle that this acne treatment comes in has a really fast flow when you're dispensing it, making it kind of wasteful. I kept one of the blemish stick roller bottles and refill it with this acne treatment. It's the perfect combination!

What horrible things to put in an acne fighting productSulphur products normally work Great on acneWHAT HAPPENEDI started using this as I was coming down from a bad breakout, I was going to a wedding in a few days which with my normal acne cycles and healing should've been gone by the wedding (with my normal sulphur drying lotion).  I ran out and saw this on sale.  It was my mistake to just assume they were essentially the same. They were except a few major ingredients! My skin kept getting more and more inflammed, deeper painful knobs were coming up.  I was wondering if I had eaten something.  It just wasn't stopping.  One night I was actually in hives down my chin to my neck!  Later I noticed that I was getting what looked to be just plain cysts..pure inflammation no whitehead or anything.  I was pulling my hair out like what is happening.  I decided to take a look at the ingredients in this imposter. Talc and titanium dioxide... Really!? Who does that? I quick washed it off and ordered Eradikate my normal drying lotion, express shipping.  I will NEVER do that again.  I haven't had breakouts this bad since I started using sulphur in my skincare routine.  This has been the worst in YEARS.  I had so much makeup on at that wedding.  I am going to have scars too.

969,969,B0017SWIU4,"Mario Badescu Drying Lotion, 1 Fl Oz","All of the reviews on this product were SO mixed it seriously made me hesitate getting it because of how many things can apparently go wrong. So I flipped a coin lol and decided to purchase this item that I had high hopes for and I don’t regret it. Shipping was fast and came within 4-5 days. My lil jar came in a small bubble wrapped zip lock bag and was also surrounded by bubble wrap in the box it was shipped in, so it did not come broken like I feared. It did come shaken of course but just leaving it for a good hour or two did the trick :). When I finally tried the product it was amazing! I feared the results of some people where their acne or breakouts got worse but thankfully this did not happen to me. This product definitely reduced redness and helped push up the impurity to take it out effortlessly. Many were frustrated that this product came off in the night on their pillow but I will admit this product takes self control haha especially for a wiggly worm like myself. Depending on where I have the product I will only let myself sleep on one side or if I have it on varying spots I just stay on my back. When I did forget and moved everywhere causing it to come off the results weren’t as good as when I stayed still and allowed the product to do its thing. Overall I’m in love with this product and definitely will repurchase!! I’m glad I took the risk and if your someone wanting to get this product but aren’t sure,I recommend physically buying it to spend less if you get different results.

1000,1000,B07B4F46KC,"Revlon ColorStay Full Cover Foundation, Toast, 1.0 Fluid Ounce","I am passionate about beauty care products and was excited to try Revlon's Colorstay Full Cover Foundation.  I used the shade medium beige and it came in a 1.0 fluid ounce tube.  I wish the tube was at least twice the size because 1.0 fluid oz of a foundation is not very much product.  I would not say this is a ""full coverage"" product by definition but it is really buildable and works well with dry areas.  Some full coverage foundations do not have enough hydration and make my skin look dry and cakey.  Though this is not full coverage it gives a very natural cover that is buildable and does not settle strangely on imperfections.  It has a slight mousse-like consistency and glides really well.  I actually like that it is not completely matte because it makes my skin look natural and hydrated. If you are looking for a very matte foundation this may not be for you.  A lot of matte products can make my skin look dry and they settle.  This does not settle poorly and almost absorbs like a lotion into the skin making it look like skin which is really unique.  It feels really nice on my face and I like that it does not draw out imperfections.  There are two things about this foundation that I would like changed.  One is that it does not contain an SPF and this is almost a necessity with a product even if I put SPF on my face first. This is one of the most important things to combat skin damage.  The second is that 1 oz is a little bit small and this will not last me long.  I like at least twice the amount of product.  Overall,  this is a really pretty foundation.  It is also super easy to work with and does not take a ton of time.  It has consistent results whether I am in a hurry or not.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71IetnkFBtL.jpg,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71vcbSwE8EL.jpg",oily,"oily_B07B4F46KC_pid1000_0,oily_B07B4F46KC_pid1000_1",https://www.amazon.com/Revlon-ColorStay-Cover-Foundation-Toast/dp/B07B4F46KC/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=B07B4F46KC&qid=1592517566&sr=8-1,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71shKib-fuL._SX679_.jpg
1001,1001,B07B4F46KC,"Revlon ColorStay Full Cover Foundation, Toast, 1.0 Fluid Ounce","I received the color Nude which was slightly lighter than my natural skin tone, which is fair with olive-yellow tones.  The foundation went on smoothly without any significant absorption.  It stayed on the top of my skin and seemed to have a slight sheen to it.I don't think this would be a good choice for women who have skin issues like acne or wrinkles they don't want to be viewed as more pronounced.  This foundation didn't feel dry, but it did feel sticky and not moisturizing.Coverage was easy to attain with very little product.  The foundation 'set' after approximately 60 seconds, so users will need to work quickly and spread the foundation expecting it to be in place and not 'blendable' after that time.The 'up to 24-hr' coverage is probably accurate.  I had to break out the cold cream to remove it from my face instead of using a light facial cleanser as I usually would do.I'm not a huge fan of this product, but if you have skin that's healthy, moisturized and under 30 and you want your make-up locked on for a full day, this one might be for you.----------------------------------------------",4.0 out of 5 stars,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/714yp3klRzL.jpg,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/7177DE3GlSL.jpg,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71k4t4zxToL.jpg,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/816mUhw1IuL.jpg",oily,"oily_B07B4F46KC_pid1001_0,oily_B07B4F46KC_pid1001_1,oily_B07B4F46KC_pid1001_2,oily_B07B4F46KC_pid1001_3",https://www.amazon.com/Revlon-ColorStay-Cover-Foundation-Toast/dp/B07B4F46KC/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=B07B4F46KC&qid=1592517566&sr=8-1,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71shKib-fuL._SX679_.jpg

Asian sunscreens, expensive sunscreen, all kinds of chemical and mineral sunscreens you name it, but nothing has ever beat this stuff. After an 8hr shift, I still look the same as I did before it.The finish is matte, not sticky, so my hair doesn’t stick to my face when the wind blows. It also doesn’t smell too strong or transfer onto anything. It holds up really well against sweat and doesn’t break down in the light so it lasts so much longer. In the winter, it’s thick enough to protect me from wind burn without being uncomfortable. My skin is dry, and my eyes sensitive, but this sunscreen doesn't give me any trouble.When it’s hot and I’m sweating a lot, I’ll re-apply about every hour, but regular conditions, I can get away with touching up every two to three. The two sun screens I always wear at work are “this” for my face, neck, and upper body, and the beach defense SPF 70 for my legs.

1043,1043,B00U1YCRD8,CeraVe Salicylic Acid Cleanser | 8 Ounce | Renewing Exfoliating Face Wash with Vitamin D for Rough and Bumpy Skin | Fragrance Free,"To make the long story short, this is great for dry, sensitive skin, and it really helps clear acne!Full review:I've had acne since I was 10, and back in the summer of 2016, I was prescribed birth control and a few months of Retin-A cream. Retin-A cream can be really harsh, so I initially only used it for my body acne and not my face. Eventually I started using a tiny amount a few times a week to help my remaining facial acne as the birth control continued to clear it and to help smooth some wrinkles and maybe fade my acne scars. However, I was still using St. Ives apricot scrub with salicylic acid and some roc retinol cream a few nights a week also. Add in some time in the sun with no sunblock, and I ended up with a terribly burned face. This, along with the dryness from a Colorado fall/early winter made my skin extremely dry and painful. I couldn't even apply moisturizer without it burning. Needless to say, I had to stop using any face wash. The dryness also started to make my skin break out, and I couldn't treat it with anything. After desperately googling remedies for my dry skin and forming acne, I started using a mixture of tea tree, argan, jojoba, rose hip, and sometimes castor oil on my face along with frequent honey masks. This fixed my dry skin, which store bought moisturizers for extremely dry skin couldn't do, but I still had terrible acne, like the worst I've ever had in my life. I started using a bar of Cerave moisturizing soap because it was on clearance at walmart for like $1 and I'd heard of people using it for acne. This helped to make my face feel cleaner, but it didn't really help my acne. I knew I needed something that could exfoliate my skin, but there was no way I was going to use something as harsh as the St. Ives scrub again. I decided to try this because I did like the Cerave bar soap even though it didn't help my acne, and this has at least some salycilic acid for exfoliation. When I first used it, I didn't think it was really going to help my acne because the consistency is so smooth and it doesn't seem like it could really exfoliate. However, after 1-2 weeks, I started to notice my skin clearing up. Slowly but surely, this face wash helped to almost completely clear my skin. I had also started taking my birth control more regularly, added a probiotic supplement, and started using vitamin c on my face, so I can't say this is the only thing that helped my acne, but it certainly contributed a lot. I also eventually started using an electric face brush to help exfoliate, and I think that could've helped. I still get acne around my period, and because I'm a college senior, so I'm always super stressed, don't get enough sleep, and don't always eat right. Also, you can't tell from the pictures, but I have quite a few blackheads on my nose. The face wash has helped clear some of those and make them smaller, but I have yet to find a product that actually completely gets rid of them, and I've tried many. Even with the blackheads, my skin is so much better now. This face wash saved my skin, and I think it's worth every penny!Pictures:Picture 1- The right side is a picture from February 14, 2017 without any makeup after starting my oil treatment. The left side is from April 7, 2017 with makeup, but you can still see how awful my skin was. I didn't start using the face wash until around the end of April.Picture 2- The left part is from July 7, 2017, and the two on the right are both from July 17, 2017. I am wearing makeup in all of these pictures, but you can tell that my skin had improved significantly. Few pimples, but lots of acne scars from the breakout.Picture 3- Both were taken August 21, 2017 with make up. Once again you can see I don't have many pimples, just terrible acne scars.Picture 4- The left part was taken December 12, 2017. I was testing a BB cream, so it is cover the bottom half of my face, but you can see that my skin looks pretty clear. The top right side was taken December 13 with the BB cream on my entire face. The bottom right picture was taken today with no makeup. As I said previously, I still get pimples from stress and periods, but they are usually small and mild instead of the giant lumps I was getting before, and they go away really quickly using cosrx pimple patches (definitely check those out) and vitamin c serum. Also, please note that I do have freckles, so most of the spots on my face are just freckles or dark marks from old acne I am still trying to get rid of. Sorry for the long review, and all the pictures with makeup (I didn't take many without makeup when my skin was that bad), but I hope it helped!",5.0 out of 5 stars,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61-h08fC8aL.jpg,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61IWPqbv+OL.jpg,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61kir8eR3lL.jpg,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61p72FQahFL.jpg",oily,"oily_B00U1YCRD8_pid1043_0,oily_B00U1YCRD8_pid1043_1,oily_B00U1YCRD8_pid1043_2,oily_B00U1YCRD8_pid1043_3",https://www.amazon.com/CeraVe-Salicylic-Cleanser-Exfoliating-Fragrance/dp/B00U1YCRD8/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=B00U1YCRD8&qid=1592517739&sr=8-3,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51yzRoBWt%2BL._SL1000_.jpg

The results are paying off for me so I will continue using! There are no smell that I can pick up on this and it feels clean! The SA cream if you use after the wash is thick but I use it sparingly.

I have veryyyy dry skin and it evened my skin tone and texture tremendously without feeling greasy like other dry skin moisturizers. The best way I can describe it is it leaves your skin feeling “tightened” and youthful.HOWEVER, they changed the formula completely. The consistency, scent, and even COLOR changed. I’ve attached a side by side picture on the back of my hand to show the original product and the recent one. You can see that the original is a light yellow color, and the new one is pure white. I also violently shook my hand, and already you can see that the new consistency is runny and beginning to drip. When applied to the skin, the application felt like I was putting water on my face. It felt cheap and useless for dry skin, which was super disappointing because the original formula was thick, rich, and left your skin with a nice glow.I gave the new moisturizer a chance, but it did not do anywhere near the same job as the original.

When you apply it you can feel the watery complexion and it dries really fast so you never feel your face hydrated.

Didn't do it right and neck turned red, so tried on crepey skin on my hands and forearms, wow.  Crepey skin was diminished a LOT within a week.I had been using a derma roller for moderate scars on one cheek and the 11 lines you get between your eyebrows.  Not working quite as well as I would like.  Tried this.  WOW, BETTER than derma roller by a LOT!BUT HERE'S THE THING.....IT IS STRONG.  SO I use a VERY SMALL amount, wait a bit for it to dry and then put hyaluronic cream or lotion over areas I used this.  HELPS with any irritation.  I can even use a BIT on my neck now.SO PROS:IT FREAKING WORKS!CONS:CAN BE IRRITATING, but I find the hyaluronic cream or lotion I put over it helps a lot.

I bought it as it was very reasonably priced. I normally buy Vaseline body lotion but bought this for a change. It worked great. I was worried about the consistency and texture after reading lot of reviews. I am glad I took the chance. It is very thick in texture and rich in quality. Well nourishing and moisturizing. Gets absorbed in skin really fast. Good for daily use. I had only two concerns ... the scent is good on its own but doesn’t gel with my body scent very well (I am glad it fades off in sometime) It’s little milky kind of scent and other is I agree with other users that bottle in little empty on the top. May be it’s meant to be that quantity  but bottle doesn’t come sealed in a plastic pack so that can be worrisome to few.

My newest scars have definitely been improving but my old scars still seem to be pretty dark. My face does feel alot smoother and more moisturized. It hasn't been irritating my skin and it's a great moisturizer. I use a very little bit just to get a thin layer over my face then I apply my lotion on top. I've also been using African black soap and witch hazel so the combination of these things may have resulted in this outcome but overall I'd say it's a pretty good product as adding it to my routine has seemed to help.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61EozL6kZML.jpg,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61Lpc9x9ZeL.jpg",oily,"oily_B000VPPUEA_pid1236_0,oily_B000VPPUEA_pid1236_1",https://www.amazon.com/Bio-Oil-2oz-Multiuse-Skincare-Oil/dp/B000VPPUEA/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=B000VPPUEA&qid=1592518210&sr=8-1,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71NAZ7a2iWL._AC_SL1500_.jpg

This oil seems to be fading them all!I put it on once a day after the shower (if that), and I've noticed the progress, even without photos. I also think that it helps to spread/lengthen the life of other lotions as well (given that it is an oil, if you put lotion on your legs, less will go longer than without the oil), so it helps you save money in the lotion department.First pictures are when I first got bit, second is when I was trying products to fade the mark, and last is now.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61IGAEmdLaL.jpg,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61q4WVFsowL.jpg,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/713OKYVcK3L.jpg",oily,"oily_B000VPPUEA_pid1239_0,oily_B000VPPUEA_pid1239_1,oily_B000VPPUEA_pid1239_2",https://www.amazon.com/Bio-Oil-2oz-Multiuse-Skincare-Oil/dp/B000VPPUEA/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=B000VPPUEA&qid=1592518210&sr=8-1,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71NAZ7a2iWL._AC_SL1500_.jpg

I have systemic lupus and cutaneous lupus  of the skin. When my skin is flared I get bullous sores and open lesions mostly on my neck, arms and face. In 2017 I had one of the worst flares I have ever had. I did not think my skin would ever completely recover and look 'normal' again. I used 7 large bottles between 2017 and 2019. I also use natural non commercial toiletry products that I make myself.  I cannot say that my skin cleared solely  by just using this product,  however the fading of scars for me was definitely noticable (see photos)  The oil does help with new scars. Not too much for old scars. To me this worked better than 100 percent cocoa butter.  It took about a year of using this to see a difference. And I will be honest I did not use it every day. The time span between the photos is about a year and a half. The bio oil worked well on my chest, arms and face but not so much on the thighs and buttocks. I didn't find it very moisturizing at all but I purchased it for scars so wasnt too disappointed with that part. Overall I'm glad I tried it. The only negative is the fragrance. I do not use fragrance of any kind as it irritates my skin. The fragrance in the oil however didn't irritate my skin but I wish it wasnt there.

My face is sooooo smooth and my eyes are already loosing the wrinkles! The right eye looks ""puffy"" but that's mainly because I have more and deeper wrinkles on that side.  I just put it on so it seems to be like that for a few hours then go down a bit.  However, the left eye is remarkably different.  I think the right will need time to catch up.  Not the creams fault- just my face composition.  I used it twice a day for two days- with tumeric soap to wash.  Can't wait to see 30 days results!  This is like half the price of the drug store or other brands and seems to be working amazingly! definitely work a try for 22 bucks. idk if it works on sensitive skin or not because my skin hasn't really had a reaction or broken out to anything ever.

The part about ""3 essential.... B5"" is not on my tube. It is on the box the tube comes in. I have emailed Cerave and am waiting for an answer as to if there is any difference in formulation, but I don't believe there is. I thought I had gotten the wrong product until I check around online.I have combo skin: lightly oily in t-zone but dry everywhere else on the face - which is why I needed this.My skin is sensitive to anything harsh and it has not reacted badly to this.I would suggest doing a spot test by applying to a small area for a week or two before using all over.  I also suggest making sure to wear a good sunscreen while using this and going out into the daylight.I like the applicator tip because it allows me to dispense the product in small increments.The way I use this is to moisten my face so that it's a bit damp & then applying this by patting small dots of it around the dry areas of my face. I let this dry and then I apply my regular moisturizer.Someone once suggested to always apply face serums & moisturizers in the order of thinnest  to thickest.I also find that using my fingers to apply by lightly pat or tap the face treatments help them absorb better.

Oz,"Cerave is one of the VC products affordable to me as I am a graduate student living paycheck by paycheck. I bought it a month ago. It is not harmful to me and also improves my skin.First of all, it does not cause any side reaction on my face (I did do a patch test before applying to the whole face though). I guess 10% is on the lower end. I use my fingertips to massage it on my face. It absorbs really fast and also moisturizes my skin.I also noticed my skin tone become a bit more even, not very much though. My skin is still yellow, which becomes brighter and firmer. Especially the T zone is less oily.Well I don’t know if it is really the vitamin c in it or the hydronic acid that is working. But it is at least not harmful.That said, I do have one complaint.I really like the airtight tube and the cream inside it has not discolored so far. But the serum does change a little once you squeeze it out. You can see from my pic that the edge of the cream becomes orange, different from the original white to yellow, indicating the oxidation of vitamin C (it is within half a minute after I pump it out). It is even more so if my palm is wet.  I know vitamin c is very reductive, which is exactly the reason it can be an anti-oxidant. But I did not know it gets oxidized so easily.  Even though the part oxidized is small and I don’t know about other brands, I still hope this formula may be improved.Overall,  I will make a second purchase to see the effect in the long run and will definitely keep vitamin c in my skincare routine.",5.0 out of 5 stars,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71injdGHD-L.jpg,oily,oily_B07PNCCLD2_pid1296_0,https://www.amazon.com/CeraVe-Vitamin-Hyaluronic-Brightening-Fragrance/dp/B07PNCCLD2/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=B07PNCCLD2&qid=1592521480&sr=8-1,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61kW3BJ5jiL._SL1000_.jpg

1302,1302,B003BMJGKE,"Eucerin Advanced Repair Lotion, Fragrance Free, 16.9 Fl Oz","This comment might get deleted since comments I write are usually deleted if they are not positive.I ordered eucerin advanced repair lotion. I currently am struggling with having eczema all over the right side of my trunk. I really needed this lotion because I don't have much of it left. My rash has been really bad this week, and I am using a lot of this lotion.Instead I got something else as shown in the picture I submitted with this review. I got some type of advanced cleansing body and face cleanser, which will not provide me with relief from the burning and itching of my eczema throughout the day. The rash is really very painful, and the lotion I ordered has been working for me all month, and I can use it throughout the day.I really don't like that. I think Amazon should be careful to send people what they order because people need exactly what they order. I am sorry to write a negative review. I am sorry if any review that isn't positive is viewed as offensive. This review is not meant to harass or bully the seller or Amazon. This review contains no profanity or any language that offends anybody based on who they are.

The oil isn't too thick on the skin but I have tried to wear it under my makeup and had disastrous results. Its a NO NO for under the makeup facial oil usage. I have also tried to use it nighttime but I didn't feel like my skin was moisturized and overtime I feared that it was starting to look dull.

I really only need to use it in the summer as my skin gets incredibly oily normally, but living in the north I actually get much dryer in the winter so I definitely don't use it as often. I've been using this for 6 months or so now and still have plenty left as you can see. I've read most of these reviews to see what others thought about it and the negative ones while true, they give the product the ability to do its work.Yes, the mask is watery as you can tell and can get quite messy. It's easy to clean up with a wet washcloth though...the liquidiness is due to the product settling. It's got a clay like substance that sinks to the bottom, so if you don't feel all the way down it will seem like straight water. I actually vigorously shake it up for a second and everything is well mixed. When I remove the cap, it's got a coating for the mask and what's in that cap is ALL I NEED for my whole face.As for the smell..no it isn't like frolicking in a freshly rained upon meadow of tulips and Poppys but if you don't use any product unless it smells good you're not giving your skin the best it deserves. GOOD SKINCARE SHOULD NOT SMELL GOOD! If it doesn't, it's generally a good indicator that the product is all natural and not too harsh for your skin. Fragrances are a lot of the time not natural, they can cause allergic reactions, and can be too harsh or strip the skin. Once you can warp your brain to understand all that stuff you'll never want to go a few hundred dollar Chanel product that smells like roses. (Not saying they have products that don't work at all!

He said could it be from the cream or the food I ate. Yet still he advised me to stop using this product. But because I really like what product does to my face, I decided to buy new one from the pharmacy(not on sale). And just like I thought, I'm not allergic to Olay!!!😊 Because I've been using the new one  from the pharmacy for more than a month now and never had any inflammation.

So I bought an unopened bottle and travel home to Vietnam with it. When I opened the bottle, it was horrendous. Cream and oil were separated. I naively thought that the cream just came out wrong because of the pump so I went ahead and applied it to my face and neck. After a few minutes, the whole face burned. I washed off the cream right away but my face and neck still have red rashes. It's also itchy and very uncomfortable. I told a friend about it and she said the same thing happened with the night cream she bought from the same product line. She did not bother to file a complain because she doesn't leave in the States. This is not supposed to happen. I have purchased many cosmetic products, including those from other Aveeno's product lines, and traveled internationally with them but none of this malfunction has happened before.The worst part about my experience is Aveeno's customer service line. Will, the product specialist, insisted that all they can do about my damage is giving me a refund in a check. I asked him to deposit the amount to my US bank account since I cannot cash out the check in Vietnam and he said he's unable to do so. After being so useless, he asked me to answer a very personal survey that would last up to 15 minutes. I stopped the survey when he asked me my date of birth as I knew it's going to get very personal. I offered to answer the survey over mail and again he said no, it has to be done over the phone.Aveeno really needs to reform their customer service policies if they want to keep their international customers. This is the most rigid and unhelpful customer service line I have ever come across in the States. What I paid for the product was not much (about 15 bucks including tax) but the least they could do is being flexible about the refund to compensate the clients' damage. That's what store credits, cash back, and other refund types are for! Instead, they choose to harass the customers with personal questions and cut corners by rounding down the retail price of the product. The customer service specialist said he will put a check of $13 in the mail for me, as it is the average retail price. The $2 difference does not make me any richer, but it does make me angrier about the way this company treats its customers. I will now stop using Aveeno altogether and tell everyone I know to boycott it.",1.0 out of 5 stars,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61Mi8H6KtZL.jpg,oily,oily_B0013OKSAY_pid1387_0,https://www.amazon.com/Aveeno-Positively-Moisturizer-Sunscreen-Non-Comedogenic/dp/B0013OKSAY/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=B0013OKSAY&qid=1592524146&sr=8-1,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71SS91aHIqL._SL1500_.jpg

As far as I'm concerned, it's my holy grail of moisturizers, and I've tried Clinique, SKII, La Prairie, La Mer, La Roche Posay, Avene...the amount I've spent trying to find a good antiaging moisturizer is almost obscene, considering the modest price tag on this simple little orange jar.Don't let the packaging fool you- the jar is pretty but it IS plastic, and it feels a little like kid's toy (it has that soft plastic feel and weight). It comes with a spatula and, depending on the length of your fingernails/how fussy you are about getting bacteria into the jar from your fingers, you will definitely want to use the spatula, because the moisturizer is a little goopy.To me, the smell is reminiscent of that classic St. Ives collagen moisturizer, with a hint of citrus added. It's a little strong, but frankly it could smell like wet dog and I would still use it, for how well it works. That being said, if you're sensitive to fragrances you'll want to keep this in mind- it does NOT have a mild smell, but it will go away quickly.I use this essentially every single day, sometimes twice a day. Always in the morning under my Shiseido sunscreen (followed by makeup), and sometimes at night over my tretinoin. It absorbs fairly fast, and it is really, really soothing in the winter, if your skin gets dry. In the winter my skin will reach the point where only avocado oil doesn't make it sting, but of all the moisturizers I've used, this one stings the least and for the shortest amount of time. I've used it on hot days as well, and on my dry skin it's perfect, though I'm not sure how well it would work for normal/oily skin. It might be a bit heavy.I'm on my second jar, and my only regret is that it doesn't come in a giant economy size, so that I could literally cover myself in it during the cold months. It's such a relief to have finally found a product that moisturizes, plumps up fine lines, and doesn't cost a small fortune!",5.0 out of 5 stars,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61wrBMd-e8L.jpg,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71m+R6rjUIL.jpg",oily,"oily_B016AEC63I_pid1389_0,oily_B016AEC63I_pid1389_1",https://www.amazon.com/Moistfull-Collagen-Moisturizing-Facial-Lasting/dp/B016AEC63I/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=B016AEC63I&qid=1592521893&sr=8-1,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61qRUf5gVWL._SL1000_.jpg

Try it for at least a week before making your decision.This is NOT as thick as Clinique. It does absorb fast, but as I write this (30 min after applying), I don’t think my face has ever felt this smooth and soft.This DOES have a scent to it. Much stronger than Clinique, but I like the scent. To each their own on this.5 stars for me as a Clinique Replacement.

1392,1392,B016AEC63I,"ETUDE HOUSE Moistfull Collagen Cream, Soft Moist Gel Type Moisturizing Facial Cream, 63.4% Super Collagen Water & Bobab Water Makes Skin Plumpy with Long Lasting Moist, 2.53 Fl Oz","Used for 5 months from August 2018 to now (January 2019).SUMMARY PROS/CONS (if you don’t want to read the whole review):PROS:- Did not clog pores (non-comedogenic).- Good for normal and combination skin.- Smells good.- Lasts approximately 4 months of using twice/day on a regular basis.- Shows results in as little as a week, or in as long as a month.- Keeps skin hydrated all day.- Light-weight on the face.- Proper hydration eventually turns skin plumper.- Did not cause acne or breakouts.- Did not irritate.- Fl oz Size is just small enough to pass through flight TSA (but I don’t bring the whole thing with me anyways).- Absorbs well.CONS:- Fragranced.- Some have said it smells too strong (but it was fine for me).- May not work for chronically dry skin.NEITHER PROS nor CONS:- Price: average $14 and lasts 4 months, so not too bad, but this was considered expensive for me when I first bought it.- Container is plastic: I thought product would be inferior to glass products, but this moisturizer works for me, so can’t complain how it’s packaged as long as it works.REVIEW:Did it cause anything negative to my face:This Etude House Moistfull Collagen Cream didn’t make my face look oily, didn’t clog my pores, didn’t get heavy on my face, hydrates well, and absorbs into my skin really adequately. Plus, it’s a smell that I do like.How good is the hydration:The cream goes on smooth, and absorbs into my skin pretty quickly. I didn’t have to wait very long to feel my skin hydrated. But I actually didn’t buy this product as a “moisturizer”. The only reason I bought it was because it said “Collagen”, and I had thought that’s what my lackluster and dull skin needed 5 months ago.  Anyways, a week later, my face felt so baby-butt soft, smooth, and bouncy that I couldn’t stop touching it. I was amazed! I was sold. It was a happy-accident! The hydration that it provides made my once flat and dull skin a bit plumper too! It keeps my skin hydrated all day.Does it smell:I do like the smell as well. It grew on me. To me, it isn’t strong, but it definitely leaves an Etude House impression (as others have said it smells very Etude House).Recommended to first-timers:But this was just my first Korean moisturizer (and luckily worked). So, I would recommend this as a good Korean moisturizer for first-timers and for people who are wondering which they should get and just overwhelmed on choosing one, especially for normal-skin-types. There are always better and more hydrating Korean moisturizers, ones that are pricier and ones that are cheaper. It just all depends on your skin type and your needs. I know I’m ready to try something new and better, because I know that if others fail, I will always have this to fall back on.CONCLUSION:It was just really nice to find something that I wasn’t even looking for, and it happens to do well with my skin type and made it silky smooth.  Yes, there are better ones at about the same price or more expensive, but this one DEFINITELY SHOWS RESULTS in as little as a week. The price is alright too, considering everything ($9 if you’re lucky but ships from Korea in 30 days, usually $14 but already at USA Amazon warehouses so ships in a couple days).This is the moisturizer that I started out with before I ventured out into more expensive Korean moisturizers, and I gotta say that I’m really glad I did because I realized more expensive does not always mean better! I would buy this again in a heartbeat (I already have).HOW OFTEN & HOW DO I USE IT:I used it religiously every day and night for the first month, then once a day at night afterwards. At first, my skincare routine was just wash my face with regular cleanser then slap this on, but I found that my skin was more accepting and hydrating with this cream with regular exfoliating. Exfoliating just once every 2 weeks really made a huge difference; it was like night and day with how this cream absorbed into and hydrated my skin. Plus, exfoliating kept my pores from clogging up with ANY of the products I’m now using. Now, I also use a toner (Son & Park Beauty Water) and a First Treatment Essence before I apply this Etude House Moistfull Collagen Cream.OTHER PRODUCTS I’VE USED AND REVIEWED:At around the same time as right now, I’ve also reviewed the following after using for 5-11 months, if you’re interested in checking out:- Etude House Moistfull Collagen Cream, 2.53 Fl Oz.- Etude House New Moistfull Collagen Eye Cream, 0.94 Ounce.- MIZON Black Snail All In One Cream, 2.40 Ounce.- MISSHA M Perfect Cover BB Cream No.23 Natural Beige SPF42 PA+++ (50ml) and No.21.- [MIZON] Snail Repair Intensive Ampoule Set + Snail Repairing Foam Cleanser 60ml.- [MIZON] All in One Snail Repair Cream (120ml).- MIZON Snail Repair Blemish Balm, 1.69 Ounce.Additional info about my SKIN, AGE, SEX, ACNE CONDITION, PORES, ETC if you’re interested:- Combination skin with both dry, normal, and oily skin in different areas, with the oiliness being at my t-zone. The dry skin is around the crevices of my nose near my nostrils and near the mouth.  But mostly, my skin is normal everywhere else.- 33 years old woman/female who never took care of her skin prior to 2018 (sad truth!), but I also rarely like to put makeup on either except for powder in the past (and BB cream nowadays).- Moderate amount of acne scars and some sun spots, but no major skin flaws. I’ve never had any huge problems with acne except during my youth before 20, and one or two pimples during my period.- My pores WERE only big on my t-zone, a small area on my chin, and facial pores near each side of my nose. They used to be a problem before 2018, but now only my nose has the largest pores, which isn’t even very big anymore after I’ve been taking care of my skin.- I exfoliate my skin at least twice a month.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61Yt5mEh8uL.jpg,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61aqQ4HpOOL.jpg,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71D7fEbumiL.jpg",oily,"oily_B016AEC63I_pid1392_0,oily_B016AEC63I_pid1392_1,oily_B016AEC63I_pid1392_2",https://www.amazon.com/Moistfull-Collagen-Moisturizing-Facial-Lasting/dp/B016AEC63I/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=B016AEC63I&qid=1592521893&sr=8-1,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61qRUf5gVWL._SL1000_.jpg

I just noticed I've purchased this cream 7 times on Amazon. This is by far the longest I've stayed with a moisturizer or any skin care product. The translucent jelly is light, yet packs powerful hydrating ingredients. It beats the $150 department store French cream that feels like lard on the face. I'm 56 years old, have dry skin, and live in a known dry region of the country. I've used countless number of products that boast moisturizing and hydrating power, but none comes close to what this cream offers. I use this cream for both day and night. It's light enough to use in the day. It absorbs quickly and foundation goes on easily and stays on naturally. I do use a heavier serum at night before applying this cream and find it quite lasting.

1405,1405,B07S98BMH9,Cerave SA Cream | 19 oz | Renewing Salicylic Acid Body Cream for Rough & Bumpy Skin | Fragrance Free,"OMG. I had a serious psoriasis outbreak and I was beside myself with pain & itching.  I read that salicylic acid helps psoriasis. I searched on Amazon for different creams and purchased this while on travel.  The cream has a nice texture and it is not too greasy and does not stain. It did not burn or tingle after I applied it. Within 24 hours my psoriasis started to heal up & the itch subsided. I was shocked that all my red spots and plaques completely healed up within 48 hours. I will use this creme 4 for the rest of my life, I highly highly recommend trying this creme if you suffer from psoriasis. The results will astound you. And I have tried many creams including prescription creams that the mayo clinic prescribed for me. Unbelievable as it sounds this cream worked the best for me. Check out my before and after pictures. I just wish I had stock in this company or had an ownership interest because this cream is going to make them a fortune.  Also if you are a psoriasis sufferer no matter what cream you put on you, you must be careful not to scratch. Where ever you scratch you will spread the psoriasis. So wash your  hands  each time you apply cream  to a different area of your body. If you do not you will spread the psoriasis. I know because I’ve had it now for year ( mine was brought on by Exemestane (Aromasin)  and I have studied psoriasis extensively. I am a nurse and I understand the importance of contact and spreading of skin diseases. I hope that my review will help psoriasis sufferers everywhere because until I discovered that salicylic acid can help  psoriasis and then discovered this cream that has the perfect formulation, I was miserable. I was crying in pain and worried that it would spread to my face. And it had started on my face but this  wonderful cream cleared it up.

1406,1406,B07S98BMH9,Cerave SA Cream | 19 oz | Renewing Salicylic Acid Body Cream for Rough & Bumpy Skin | Fragrance Free,"I have been suffering from KP bumps and ingrown hairs for a really long time ( over a decade now). I have tried so many things to get rid of these bumps. A little background into my personal situation is that I have a milk chocolate skin tone and it is generally very silky smooth. My skins main issue beside the KP is that my skin is very sensitive and prone to dryness ( I have read that KP and ingrown hairs are common in those who have sensitive skin since KP is a overproduction of keritin to protect the skin [is the guess] but it is genetic and usually rarely goes away for most [ contrary to popular belief]). So I have had these bumps for so long and I have tried exfoliates and moisturizers but in vain. My problem areas are the backs of my arms especially around the elbows,the front of my thighs and the most severe place is the bottom half of my legs around the knee area. My main issue was to smooth the bumpy texture of these bumps. I always used shower puffs and Aveeno ( as my general daily moisturizer I still use it) and most recently Goldbond for Rough and Bumpy Skin. The Goldbond moisterizer was a 6/10 because it really aided the bumps on my thighs and the back of my arm but did nothing for my most severe location by my knees. After I waxed again ingrown hairs arrived on my thighs and the Goldbond did nothing so I decided to find a new solution.  I always used Cerave products but the price on this lotion really had me holding back from trying it but I finally did and I am so glad I did. I have been using to for only a month now but within the first few days there was a noticeable change and the bumps are all smoothed out. Unlike other moisturizers like the Goldbond it does not peel off and for a thick lotion it absorbs quickly into the skin. I use it every day, after I shower I just stand for about 5 minutes to make sure it fully absorbs and I thought I would never feel my silky smooth skin on my legs again but I finally did! I paired the Cerave with exfoliation for maximum results  used Earth Therapeutics Hydro Exfoliating glove as well and Gigi no bumps body scrub and both of them left my skin sooooo soft after showering but the Cerave just got rid of the rest of the bumps. I strongly recommend this for anyone suffering from KP and ingrown hairs! Especially if you have a bump issue. I am dark skin so the appearance of KP bumps discoloration is not to noticeable on my skin but I did notice a little fade in discoloration but not a whole lot so far after 2 weeks or so all my bumps smoothed and only time will tell if the discoloration will go away signifcantly. Overall a 10/10! 5 stars! I can't believe it works! I recommend it to anyone but remember to exfoliate as well for best results. Hope this long review helps someone.UPDATE 2/6/2017: ( The picture is from the beginning of 2017. After using the product for a few months after purchasing it in 2015, this was my results and they have been consistant since [throughout the rest of 2015-2016 and now 2017].) After using this product for about almost two years now it has worked very well! I regret not taking before shots because I assumed like all the other products I tried that it would not work or do anything, so there was no point! Ugh! I regret it! This product still works for me and I am happy my skin has not adjusted to it. My routine is the same,an exfoliating glove, dove soap, my GiGi scrub and Aveeno lotion that is fragrance free. I was about once a month because I generally am not harry and I exfoliate before and after my waxes and I use this to moisturize for about a week after my wax. I also use it randomly, especially when cold even if it has been weeks since I waxed. My bumps are still visible, but has lightened only slightly. I have darker skin so they do not show up anyways. Like I said before my texture and the feel of the bumps was my concern and still is. This product has left my skin soooo smooth I feel like I never had KP bumps! My final verdict is that this is perfect for smoothing those bumps, but if you are concern with discoloration this will help but you will need something extra. However, this is still great for those with dry, KP and ingrown hair prone skin. Hope I helped :)",5.0 out of 5 stars,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71I11HpCgXL.jpg,oily,oily_B07S98BMH9_pid1406_0,https://www.amazon.com/Cerave-Cream-Renewing-Salicylic-Fragrance/dp/B07S98BMH9/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=B07S98BMH9&qid=1592521919&sr=8-1,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61wzuS1p0tL._SL1000_.jpg
1407,1407,B07S98BMH9,Cerave SA Cream | 19 oz | Renewing Salicylic Acid Body Cream for Rough & Bumpy Skin | Fragrance Free,"I’ve been working to combat my T-zone acne for several of years now. This has been a game changer for me; As before my skin was inflamed (red and the pores left open and exposed to crap in the air) 24/7. And I’ve gone through a lot of other brands to try to treat it! It’s been 1 week since I’ve been using this: twice daily and using with the SA wash! I’m posting the “before and after” photo so the photo can speak for itself! Again, this is only 7 days between photos, so it’s still in progress but I already love it! From my experience, the SA wash and cream causes a *very mild* “burning” sensation or itch but I has to be patient. It wasn’t too bothersome and it became better over time for me. The results are paying off for me so I will continue using! There are no smell that I can pick up on this and it feels clean! The SA cream if you use after the wash is thick but I use it sparingly. Good luck to you guys. My skin was complicated and I hope it works for you guys like it did for me.OK UPDATE- I think it’s about 3 weeks now and as I’m using this (and my skin is continuing to clear up), and as I am starting to put a little dent into the jar... as I rub the cream into my face, I’m noticing sharp little shards of solid pieces!!! It almost looks like fiber glass. Not sure what it is and it does poke into my skin and I am wondering if that’s what I was feeling (mild burning, or even micro cuts... so the product can “exfoliate” that I mentioned on my first review during 1st week of use). Ok I don’t mind exfoliating HOWEVER what if I accidentally get some of the dried shards I to my eyes? That stuff doesn’t dissolve at all or quickly. I’ve been going alto us with my face moistened with shards sparkling on my face too. It’s noticeable when I’m in bright lighting. I don’t know if I like it anymore. :(",3.0 out of 5 stars,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61PIfa9tCRL.jpg,oily,oily_B07S98BMH9_pid1407_0,https://www.amazon.com/Cerave-Cream-Renewing-Salicylic-Fragrance/dp/B07S98BMH9/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=B07S98BMH9&qid=1592521919&sr=8-1,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61wzuS1p0tL._SL1000_.jpg
1408,1408,B07S98BMH9,Cerave SA Cream | 19 oz | Renewing Salicylic Acid Body Cream for Rough & Bumpy Skin | Fragrance Free,"I stumbled upon this product while I was trying to find something to help with the keratosis pilaris I had on my arms. I used this twice a day, once in the morning and once before bed, every day for two months. Pros: I instantly felt a difference with the moisture levels on my skin. I have constantly battled overly dry skin (in conjunction with keratosis pilaris) all my life and no other product has worked or lasts as long throughout the day as this. As a whole, the texture of my skin has shown significant and noticable improvement. I also really liked the smell. It isn't made with fragrance but the smell is nice and neutral, yet unique and pleasant. Cons: I was hoping this was going to help with the red dots on my skin. There is a slight difference in the amount/area of skin the dots span but I'm disappointed that the before and after of two months is not nearly as drastic or as noticable as I was hoping. I have also noticed that I have started to get tiny white heads on my arms. No big deal, but still not something I'm thrilled about. The two first pictures are before, the last two pictures are after I have been using this for two months. Would I buy this product again? Probably but only until I can find something else that takes care of the red dots. If you're looking for a moisturizer that WORKS buy this.

Yeah. I know. I should’ve used sunscreen, but I didn’t. So I decided to give this a shot because the Internet said they highly recommend it. BOOOOOOOY, I’m shook. It didn’t happen over night, but after 3 months of consistently exfoliating every night and using this lotion twice a day, you can honestly see a significant difference. Peep the pictures. Especially with the texture of my skin. Now visually, it’s still there, but not as bad as before. I really recommend giving this a try. It works. Slowly, but surely. If you’re curious about the product it is a bit thick applying it on and a little sticky afterwards, but it eventually soaks into your skin and you can kind of feel it throughout the day on your skin, but don’t let that discourage your purchase.

If someone has them on sale, I really stock up. All of us use it, especially during the winter. When an equivalent Amazon product came up, I grabbed it. At first I was put off by the fact that the Solimo moisturizer seems much waxier in the tub. It looks a bit bubbled and resists scooping with a definitely firm and waxy-seeming texture. The Cetaphil is much creamer and smoother. It takes several seconds longer for the Solimo to soak in, yet after both moisturizers sink in, neither is greasy and each seems to work just as well as the other.I’m assuming that the Solimo brand has more coconut oil, giving it the thicker consistency. I’m uploading pictures to show the Solimo just as you put it on, before it warms up and really starts to sink in, then pictures after showing that, even though it seems waxy, it actually leaves no greasy residue after it warms and is rubbed in.Having used Cetaphil cream for years, I believe the Solimo cream moisturizer is equivalent, even though it takes several seconds longer to soften and sink in.Let Amazon donate to your favorite charity!

I am 47 and live and die by my spf and moisturizer, so  if you grew up as a sun worshipper, you are probably screwed by my age anyway.I have pretty extensive training in makeup and airbrush from the best, so  this is what works for me.  I use a light application of oil-free  foundation...but, the trick is to mix it with everything first. Add a small dab of the gel cream on the back of your hand, mix with a good dab of a moisturizing, double duty sunscreen. I use the Olay Radiant Glow for moisture and a little of the Loreal Silky Sheer for the higher SPF and just because it really is silky. I also use a drop of foundation  to even my skin tone and a dab of primer (Elf works well because it is cheap and has a convenient pump). It sounds like a lot of product but... It is about the size of a nickel on the back of the hand.  Next swirl this around with your fingertip really well.  It will warm up and combine right there.  Once it combines it looks a little wet and like a LOT of liquid is going on your face, but remember, it is very little color and you are going to cover your neck, to your ears, and blend in to any exposed decolletage.  It take a good 30 seconds to absorb, but it is still faster, once you start doing this, than doing all these steps separately.  Once the initial application is completed, you will have a baby-smooth canvas to apply makeup to. You can apply additional foundation my fuller coverage without piling. You can apply additional sunscreen if you are worried about burning, or another application of moisturizer.  If you use a good spray setter this will also help hold the moisture in a little longer than just a powder, which will set your makeup but can be drying.  I hope this helps. I also experienced the ""pilling"" wgen I first got the gel and this is how I solved the problem.",4.0 out of 5 stars,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61clYoquHjL.jpg,oily,oily_B00I4BUBN8_pid1509_0,https://www.amazon.com/Hada-Labo-Tokyo-Plumping-Cream/dp/B00I4BUBN8/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=B00I4BUBN8&qid=1592522520&sr=8-1,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71fFWXMdjGL._AC_SL1500_.jpg

1517,1517,B07YLKXV11,CeraVe Tinted Sunscreen with SPF 30 | Hydrating Mineral Sunscreen With Zinc Oxide & Titanium Dioxide | Sheer Tint for Healthy Glow | 1.7 Fluid Ounce,"When it comes to choosing a sunscreen, it is between mineral/physical blocks and chemical blocks. Each offer pros and cons, and it comes down to what works best for your life style, your skin and what other needs you are trying to gain from it.  I like mineral sunscreens, and most work well for me because I have fair skin tone and the white cast isn't too noticeable. Many of the tinted mineral sunscreens attempt to lessen the white cast but still leave a hint of a white cast- again mostly fine for me but it leaves out a lot of other skin tones. Usually ones needs a chemical sunscreen to avoid the white cast, and need a chemical sunscreen for more options in using an SPF that is hydrating and/or tinted. But not everyone tolerates chemical sunscreens. Conundrum!My sensitive skin (non acne rosacea) prefers a mineral sunscreen. I tend to keep my day time skin care simple, and since sunscreen is the most important thing no matter the season, I prefer to use one that can double as a moisturizer.  This light coverage tint makes me feel a little more polished. I can tell there is a little tint but it is super sheer.The CeraVe HYDRATING tinted mineral sunscreen has a broad spectrum SPF of 30. It has a sheer tint that initially appears a tad dark and orangey against my fair pink toned skin. I applied it both on my forearm as well as on my face. True to form, this formula blended seamlessly into my skin. Any off coloring dissipated shortly after application. It is most noticeable on my forearm so I included pics of it being applied, just as it was spread on, and then after it absorbed. Most importantly, I am not noticing ANY white cast. Not sure how dark of skin tone one can go before it appears too light, but if the seemingly darker color is absorbing into my skin, then perhaps it works similarly to those further along in color spectrum? My skin is super light, pink based, and this does add a touch of warm color but not so much that it looks too dark.Additionally, what I really like it that my skin feels hydrated and slightly dewy. Not greasy. Not covered in sunscreen. My skin leans dry, so I definitely like this. Love that it contains skin barrier protecting ceramides (helps hold skin together by forming a protective layer that limits moisture loss and protects against visible damage from pollution and other environmental stressors) as well as niacinamide (a water-soluble vitamin that works with the natural substances in your skin to help visibly improve enlarged pores, uneven skin tone, fine lines and wrinkles, dullness, and a weakened surface).  Allergy tested  Fragrance-free  Paraben-free  Oil-free  Non-comedogenic  Suitable for sensitive skin  Gentle on the skinI found that I can apply it after my typical skin care routine (hydrating toners, moisturizer, then this), OR just this as my only skin care. I have tried it under powder make up as well as a liquid. It plays well with both. No pilling on my end. I love CeraVe so I am stoked that this has been so good for me.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71-jSfNleBL.jpg,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/7137lQ7d0SL.jpg,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71OrVlTMyqL.jpg,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71TVTYRmkdL.jpg,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71awQAyNfJL.jpg,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71sJwyBKKHL.jpg",oily,"oily_B07YLKXV11_pid1517_0,oily_B07YLKXV11_pid1517_1,oily_B07YLKXV11_pid1517_2,oily_B07YLKXV11_pid1517_3,oily_B07YLKXV11_pid1517_4,oily_B07YLKXV11_pid1517_5",https://www.amazon.com/CeraVe-Sunscreen-Hydrating-Mineral-Titanium/dp/B07YLKXV11/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=B07YLKXV11&qid=1592522640&sr=8-1,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51za73urb4L._SL1000_.jpg
1518,1518,B07YLKXV11,CeraVe Tinted Sunscreen with SPF 30 | Hydrating Mineral Sunscreen With Zinc Oxide & Titanium Dioxide | Sheer Tint for Healthy Glow | 1.7 Fluid Ounce,"Review of:  CeraVe Tinted Sunscreen with SPF 30 | Hydrating Mineral Sunscreen With Zinc Oxide & Titanium Dioxide | Sheer Tint for Healthy Glow | 1.7 Fluid OunceThere are really two aspects to this sunscreen that I think most people will be interested in reading about, the first is the actual sunscreen capabilities and the second is the ‘tint’ of the sunscreen.First things, first.A few years ago my skin no longer tolerated some (which one I don’t know)  of the chemicals that many of the big-box store sunscreens contained.  You know what I’m talking about, Avobenzone, Homosalate , Octisalate … all those ingredients.  So, I switched over to zinc/titanium products or, at least, as much as I could.  With Titanium dioxide at 5.5% and Zinc oxide at 10% the CeraVe Tinted Sunscreen (SPF 30) fits my sunscreen needs really well.I was surprised how well this sunscreen, especially compared to almost every other zinc oxide/titanium dioxide sunscreen, blended into my sky; and I’ve tried a few.  No more rubbing and rubbing and rubbing with CerVe, a few quick swirls and the screen had absorbed into my skin.  After being in the sun for a few hours while out walking, I can say that the SPF pieced of the product worked as well as any other, or better, than any other Zinc/Titanium I’ve used before.  Easy rub in, good protection … you can’t ask for much more.Now, moving on to the tinted portion of the sunscreen.  When I first opened the container and looked at the product I thought it might be a little too dark for my very light skin.  It turns out it really wasn’t overly dark for my skin tone.I then decided to do an experiment and let my beard stubble grow out a little bit.  Why?  Because with most Zinc/Titanium brands the whiteness of the sunscreen would make my stubble go from a greyish color to a ‘Santa Claus white beard’ look.  Look at my attached pictures and you, hopefully, will see what I mean.  With the CeraVe tinted sunscreen though, the added color of the tint helped the stubble look a little more natural.  Not a lot, mind you, but enough so the stubble blended in a did not stand out.I was pleased with the results.Keep in mind that a 1.7 fluid ounce bottle is really small and for roughly $16 (the price in late December as I write this review) you won’t get much product for the price.  Still, if the price isn’t a consideration, this is a really high-quality product that you would enjoy having and using.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51QvLDz1GiL.jpg,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51hU7x2tuIL.jpg,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71PFCzHcRHL.jpg",oily,"oily_B07YLKXV11_pid1518_0,oily_B07YLKXV11_pid1518_1,oily_B07YLKXV11_pid1518_2",https://www.amazon.com/CeraVe-Sunscreen-Hydrating-Mineral-Titanium/dp/B07YLKXV11/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=B07YLKXV11&qid=1592522640&sr=8-1,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51za73urb4L._SL1000_.jpg

A lot of tinted sunscreens I've tried are sooo pink. This one is not too bad. If they came out with more yellow tinted shades that'd be awesome.Applies well, sinks in decently well after a bit of working it in. Leaves a slightly dewy look to the skin with a slight cast. The cast and dewyness goes away after a few minutes though and sets to a very natural finish. I think this could work with a variety of skin tones but would likely work *best* on light to medium/tan skin tones.  Deeper skin tones may still experience a bit of a cast.This sunscreen offers little coverage. It minimally evens out the skin but I wouldn't recommend it if you're someone that is looking for coverage. I don't normally wear foundation so it works well for me.It comes with about 50ml of product which I think is becoming pretty common for more cosmetic type of sunscreen. No detectable scent though!

So yes you will get a white caste unless you don't apply enough product to get true protection. You can apply a facial powder afterwards to help out with this whiteness. I really like this one though I cannot use it on my face. I'm a natural redhead and I used this to stay outside all day long on Memorial Day weekend in Texas. This does work if you apply it properly. I cannot use it on my face because of the methylisothiazolinone (preservative known to be a sensitizer: after a number of uses it then produces an allergic reaction.)  If it did not have this in it then I would use it on my face most days for workouts or swimming.  It is not thick and sticky feeling as most water resistant sunscreens are. It has more of a lotion feel to it. Yes it is thick but not like the water resistant mineral sunscreen feel cause it will absorb.

I have been using their day cream for years now. I always bought in bulk when I saw them on sale. However, as of recent, I've noticed huge changes that I am not happy about, especially since I was not informed as a loyal consumer. First they changed to a new formula. Usually when companies do this, they have the decency to inform its consumers. Acure gave me nothing. Not only is the formula sidfeeenr, they took out a lot of organic ingredients and replaced them with cheaper. WATER is now first and major ingredient.Next, not only did they change the packaging, they changed the size of the container. The old container reads ""50 ml, 1.7 Fl Oz."" The new containers read the same measurements but the container is actually smaller than the old one! So how is that possible. There is no way I'm believing I am still getting 50ml when they old vs new containers are different sizes.(View pictures)Therefore we have New Formula, Smaller Packaging, for the Same Price, and No Notification.

I am 38, African American and I have what seems to be hormonal acne. Anyone who suffers from acne for any reason know that is tough. But I can honestly say I tried Acure not expecting because a lot of stuff hardly does what it claims. I used their sensitive facial cleanser , brightening scrub and moisturizer was their Marula oil said to be good for acne skin. I noticed my face clear beautifully! I fell off using it on a regular basis but I went back to it. I also eat organic, juice and do green smoothies as well as use all natural body care... You've gotta start from the inside! This product seems good as far as its moisturizing abilities and my skin is extra dry because I had a peel done. BUT yes the smell is funky! As one person said , I also use earth friendly and "" green"" products but not all of them smell this way. This reminded me of baby spit up .. Sorry Acure!!UPDATE::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::I want to take back what i said about the smell lol, it really isn't that bad or i am use to it. There is no denying that this works wonderfully! I switched to another moisturizer in their line and didn't like it as much so i went back. I have been sing their combo skin cleanser ( i use to use the one for sensitive skin, but notice a great diff now that i switched!), the green scrub they make for hyper pigmentation, eye cream, resurfacing cream and then this moisturizer ( sorry i can't remember all the names!). I use their new scrub that has red clay in it every other day. This i alternate with the green scrub. I know some people may say that's too much exfoliation but this has been what works for MY skin! The dark marks and spots i had are diminished GREATLY! My skin breakouts almost not at all now and people think i am wearing makeup when i'm not!

This is one of the ONLY face lotions I trust. I have extremely sensitive skin, everything makes me breakout if I don't do my research on ingredients. If it has coconut oil or coconut anything in there I don't buy it. I use a comedogenic rating for all ingredients to check, just to be safe. I  use pure shea butter in my hair and on my body and that seems fine, but I couldn't find anything for my face! I went to whole foods and asked the beauty worker what product she would recommend and this is what she said. I was reluctant to buy it for weeks. Along iwth diet changes...I've been paleo but had soy lethinin in my chocolate and gum (i've eliminated this), my skin is 100% better. I was so sad washing my face a few weeks ago and I felt so ugly! I know this product is working, because it's only been two weeks and no irritation and my skin is getting clearer. I can't attribute the lotion for clearing my skin, but i'm sure it helped heal it and the most important part is that it DOES NOT cause me any breakouts when pretty much everything does. A little goes such a long way, i'm sure i'll have the bottle for at least 2 -3 , months! Worth the price! I actually like the smell, I don't know what people are talking about, maybe it's cause I already use earthy funky smelling things, plus the smell fades fast. I also LOVE that it has probiotics!

1642,1642,B00352MHE2,"Cetaphil Daily Advance Ultra Hydrating Lotion With Shea Butter For Dry, Sensitive Skin, 16 Fl Oz (Pack of 1)","A good, heavier body moisturizer. Cetaphil's current packaging shows it is the ""middle"" of their lineup.Here in the mid-Atlantic (with our humid summers), I use it mostly during winter cold snaps, and use Cetaphil's lighter ""All Skin Types"" most of the time. Those of you living in dry climates might find it useful year around. The ingredient list is similar to that lighter lotion, but swaps the avocado oil for macadamia nut oil, and adds shea butter.The lotion is moderately heavy, you can feel it on your skin (likely the shea butter), and if you wash your hands too soon, you'll notice the slickness. I'm not a fan of this weight of lotion normally since it gets on things, and I don't want to pet my cats with it on my hands. But if you're suffering from dry skin or chapping, this is the way to go. And it's not particularly heavy or greasy compared to other heavier lotions I've tried.The odorless is worth extra praise. Manufacturers today seem to fill most products with cloying, overwhelming scents. As a typical male, I'm not really interested in my lotion (or me) smelling like cheap perfume. Worse, many synthetic scent compounds are implicated as health hazards. So an unscented lotion is the only way to go for me. Kudos for Cetaphil doing that across their product line.The packaging changes occasionally (including since last year), but the ingredients seem to stay the same. The current product photo here isn't the new packaging, so I've included a pic of it here.This is my go-to lotion during excessively dry spells.

I was also recommended this lotion for healing tattoos. biggest mistake ever. I had a healing tattoo on my forearm...thought I was having a reaction to the ink. Not likely, because I've been going to the same guy for years, he used the same ink for years. I am also covered in tattoos, my chest and my arms. The only difference was I used Cetaphil lotion instead of tattoo goo. It immediately gave me a rash, and felt like somebody threw lighter fluid on my arm and set it on fire. In the picture you can see the hives. I was between sessions for a cover-up / and waiting to get the color added. Thankfully, antihistamines and cortisone cream calmed it down (took 2 weeks to go away completely)Come to find out, Cetaphil has avocado oil in it! I'm allergic to avocados! Usually people who are allergic to avocados, have a birch pollen allergy (Myself). I advise people with sensitive skin to be careful, there are some ingredients and these supposedly hypoallergenic lotions that still cause reactions.

1660,1660,B004LZM6TI,Pond's Rejuveness Anti-Wrinkle Cream Anti-Aging Face Moisturizer With Alpha Hydroxy Acid and Collagen 14.1 oz,"Pond's, as a beauty brand, has a proven track record of positive results for millions of women.  This added anti-aging product just makes the line of products better.  Pond's Cold Cream was the very first skin care product my mother insisted I use 60 years ago (I just had my 79th birthday) and it is still my favorite makeup remover.  Mom insisted I massage a moderate amount into my skin for about 90 seconds, then wet my hand with warm water and continue to massage the cream into an emulsion, and remove with a warm wet cloth.  Now I follow that with Rejuvenesse.  In the morning I cleanse with a light cleanser and reapply the Rejuvenesse, using only enough to put a very thin coating on my skin.  My makeup goes on beautifully.  Most people don't believe I am nearly 80 years old.  Good consistent skin care with proven quality products will always make the difference.Update, Dec 2018:  continue to see improvement in my skin.  No such thing as overnight results, but consistency pays off.  After reading other reviews, I emphasize that a little goes a long way.  Too heavy?  Maybe using too much.  During the winter I put a very light layer of Ponds Dry Skin Cream on my neck and chest over the Juvenesse Cream.  Soooooo soft!!!!!Update: Its 2020, and I am now 80 years old and still convinced that this product is worth far more than what anyone ever pays for it.  I originally bought two small travel sizes and keep them handy in each of my bathrooms.  I refill from my huge jar which I keep tightly closed.  Ponds continues to perform above and beyond.  We just returned from a family visit in Oklahoma, where the winter winds are brutal!!  Thankfully I had my Rejuveness and Nourishing Creme S with me and came through the experience just fine.  I do wear a CC cream with a sunscreen as well.

I've had this cream for about 2 weeks now and I really love it. I am a college student so i'm constantly running around outside from building to building and living in new york it gets pretty cold.For a man such as myself, I've undermined the importance of daily skin care for a long time but recently I've gone further to protect my skin, because why not keep your skin healthy and lively. Whether you think so or not, having healthy skin will improve your daily quality of life. People are sure to notice the difference, and will definitely improve your self esteem. Bright, Soft, Healthy skin is good all year round!.This cream smells amazing!. Me and my mother both use this, and we both love it. just a small dab of it is enough for both my arms, hands and my face. I have definitely felt the difference on my skin after using this the past two weeks. My face feels much softer and looks better. It lasts all day and has become part of my daily routine before leaving the house. The bottle is bigger than i expected so i'm sure it will last me a couple months of use. I will be sure to update this review when it has run out and how my skin is doing after a couple of months.Overall I would definitely recommend this cream to anyone, man or woman, to include in your daily skin care, or even as a gift to a friend.

It is completely clear and is effortlessly and quickly absorbed into my skin. It has a light fragrance that reminds me of the ocean which I think is perfect but it goes away pretty quickly if you don't like fragrances. It immediately makes my skin glow and that luminous look lasts all day. I've been using it about two weeks now and my skin is hydrated, looks great and I think my pores even look smaller. It's wonderful not having to rub in moisturizer to have it absorb into my skin or end up with too much that won't rub in or white marks that don't blend in. I only wish it had an SPF.

It resembles a sticky water and it feels the same way when it dries. It does not moisturize in any way and I have oily T-zone and really just need the moderate moisture on my cheeks. My nose was peeling from dryness and regardless how much of this gel I used it made no difference whatsoever. I have not tried the Dry Skin version of this so maybe that one would have worked better for me, but this one is just awful.I really liked the glass packaging and the pump dispenser on this gel.

I had to cut that off & all the messy little edges were impossible to remove, even with tweezers. That schizz was attached with industrial grade super glue!

The first thing noticeable when opening the jar is the smell which one of heavy oil, not honey which I was expecting because that's one of the ingredients. There was a layer of olive oil floating on the top which does separate frequently and needs to be stirred back into the cream. The cream is greasy and did not soak into my skin so using it as a night cream was out of the question. It did not work as a day cream either since it just created a greasy film over my face that had to be wiped off. It is mild, did not sting or burn and can be used on the eye area with no problem.

I have veryyyy dry skin and it evened my skin tone and texture tremendously without feeling greasy like other dry skin moisturizers. The best way I can describe it is it leaves your skin feeling “tightened” and youthful.HOWEVER, they changed the formula completely. The consistency, scent, and even COLOR changed. I’ve attached a side by side picture on the back of my hand to show the original product and the recent one. You can see that the original is a light yellow color, and the new one is pure white. I also violently shook my hand, and already you can see that the new consistency is runny and beginning to drip. When applied to the skin, the application felt like I was putting water on my face. It felt cheap and useless for dry skin, which was super disappointing because the original formula was thick, rich, and left your skin with a nice glow.I gave the new moisturizer a chance, but it did not do anywhere near the same job as the original. If the company brings back the old formula, I will repurchase.

Apparently rashes are common but upon further reading - if I ever use it again - I would wash my face, apply toner and a mild moisturizer, let that dry for 30 minutes, THEN apply a tiny tiny amount just to my forehead to see if I react like this again.

1773,1773,B07XJ7XWLW,CeraVe Anti Aging Retinol Serum | 1 Ounce | Cream Serum for Smoothing Fine Lines and Skin Brightening | Fragrance Free,"I am willing to try just about any product for my face that ""claims"" it will improve my skin. Mostly I use Hyaluronic Acid Serum. I, in fact, have the CeraVe Hyaluronic product. I though this Retinol product would be the same stuff, but it is NOT. It comes in the same type of dispenser, but the cream is different. I applied both serums at night, one cheek one, the other cheek the other. When I washed in the morning the Hyaluronic product had a creamy residue that felt like I was applying it again, the Retinol product did not. I really didn't see a difference on my face after only one use. Anti-Aging products all make claims, but you don't know if you are picking what's best for you. Retinol claims to improve fine lines and wrinkles. They don't say this can only be accomplished over time. My one use didn't show to much change. On the plus side, I had no adverse effects. It was a very nice cream, and proved not to be too harsh on my face. Hyaluronic Acid claims it absorbs moisture. I know it dries into my skin after applying it, so I'd say that claim is true. I have decided that although these two products come packaged similarly, they are not the same product. I think a person can use both, not either/or. I am going to continue with the Hyaluronic product because I already know it works, but I am going to start putting on this Retinol once a week because if there is any benefit to be gotten from long term use, I am going to try to get it.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61YsS9rUxAL.jpg,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71YNvlQ3GvL.jpg,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71dsAq5UyqL.jpg",oily,"oily_B07XJ7XWLW_pid1773_0,oily_B07XJ7XWLW_pid1773_1,oily_B07XJ7XWLW_pid1773_2",https://www.amazon.com/CeraVe-Retinol-Smoothing-Brightening-Fragrance/dp/B07XJ7XWLW/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=B07XJ7XWLW&qid=1592523710&sr=8-1,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/517gCsWL7iL._SL1000_.jpg

1777,1777,B07XJ7XWLW,CeraVe Anti Aging Retinol Serum | 1 Ounce | Cream Serum for Smoothing Fine Lines and Skin Brightening | Fragrance Free,"I’m becoming a big fan of CeraVe products. I’d always ignored them before—the packaging is plain and rather boring and looks like something that would be offered in a hospital room, nothing like what you receive with pretty packaging like with L’oreal, Olay, Vichy, or Erno Laszlo, but I suspect that helps keep their cost down so they can provide a good product and not charge a big price. And that packaging was what kept me from using CeraVe—it looked uninviting. But don’t let the packaging fool you! The product inside is amazing.This serum goes on super smooth. My skin can be sensitive, but I have absolutely no problems with this retinol serum.It’s thick but still creamy so it goes easily on and absorbs quickly, an off-white or almost light  yellow in color. There is no fragrance at all, which I love for mornings when I don’t want to smell a scent while drinking my coffee after cleansing my skin.The pump action dispenser works great—the only thing I don’t like about pump dispensers is I often wonder how much product is left inside once it stops pumping (and that’s with any pump dispenser).My skin isn’t red, itchy, no burning or stinging — just really soft smooth feeling skin.The price is a bargain—it’s difficult to find good serums under $17 or $18.I have several other CeraVe skin-care products and I find I turn to them more and more for affordable skin-care options.I hope my review helped you today.",5.0 out of 5 stars,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71lfVO4Qv1L.jpg,oily,oily_B07XJ7XWLW_pid1777_0,https://www.amazon.com/CeraVe-Retinol-Smoothing-Brightening-Fragrance/dp/B07XJ7XWLW/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=B07XJ7XWLW&qid=1592523710&sr=8-1,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/517gCsWL7iL._SL1000_.jpg

In the winter, when I take off my skinny jeans, I can actually see tiny skin flakes all over the inside of my jeans - this is how dry my skin is. I have tried many body creams and I do like a few. The one that helped me get rid of all the comedones on my thigh is The Body Shop vitamin E body cream (I can't use any acid peel because of my sensitive skin). The one that helps instantly with cracking/peeling heels is L'occitane almond body lotion, but neither really stopped flaking of my leg skin. I have used Eucerin Intensive Repair and it does help, but I really hate the sticky texture and the smell is weird..it's not strong, but enough to repel me. This Curel hydra therapy not only stopped flaking of my leg skin, it also makes my skin feels so smooth. It is a lot lighter compared to the Eucerin Intensive Repair and rubs in very quickly. It is supposed to be applied when skin is still wet, but it takes longer to absorb if applied wet. I usually apply it after towel dry, and it still does the job. It has a very subtle orange smell (from orange peel I believe) which is delightful. I even decanted it into small bottles so I can carry it around to use as a hand cream. The bottle is smaller than what I expected. I use it every day after shower for my legs and arms (I apply quite generously), and it lasted about 1 month.

Helps to Repair Moisture Barrier","This is good stuff! No heavy scent or thick hard to rub in goopey feel to it.  A lotion created to be put on when your skin is wet, it glides on easily and is absorbed fairly quickly without much of a sticky residue. It can be used on dry skin as well of course, but it really is best used when you are damp out of the shower when your skin's pores are open and ready to accept the lotion.This package contains (4) 12 ounce bottles, making each one around six dollars.  Initially that price seemed a tad spendy to me, until I saw how well it worked.The lotion left my skin feeling smooth and hydrated, and this lasted for several hours post shower. **Pat yourself dry after applying for the best results versus rubbing with a towel.** Certain areas (elbows and knees) appeared drier sooner than other areas, but a reapplication to dry skin took care of that problem. The lotion is very concentrated, so whether using it wet or dry I needed very little to get the desired effect.  I did avoid putting this on my face during the day as it appeared somewhat greasy and wasn't the look I was going for with my mineral based matte make-up.I did use it at night after washing my face in place of my usual nightly moisturizer and it worked well. Wherever it is used it seems to create a moisturizing layer to the skin that acts as a barrier of sorts. I noticed it most on my hands when after applying the lotion hours later washing my hands and having them feel moisturized while washing instead of dry afterwards. Definitely seems to work best with continued use, but even with one application it's noticable.Overall, I think this is an excellent product for the whole family. It's not too greasy or sticky going on, and it is absorbed quickly without being sucked up and forever gone as with some lotions. It left my skin looking healthier (see before and after photo on my hand) and had no icky scent.

I got a tube as a sample from Crowdtap and so I wanted to give it a try and see how it worked compared to others that I have used. The moisturizer does not really have to much of a smell at all. Actually I do not think it has any smell at all. Even though there is no scent it worked extremely better than I thought, and that is fine with me. I do have really dry skin, so finding a good moisturizer is hard for me. So when I find a good one I try to stick with it!

Curel has some really great products so I just knew that this wet skin moisturizer would be nothing less then the best.I have been using for about a week now  everyday and I have noticed a difference in my skin and the way it feels. Fall is here and well going into winter and my skin changes almost for the worst. It gets very dry sometimes no matter how much moisturizer I use. It really just depends on the day and the heat. I use other great body washes that have kept my skin feeling wonderful after a shower but then I'd have to put on an additional moisturizer. When using this I noticed that it didn't take long to soak into my skin at all. Another major plus is that my  skin did'nt feel all extra sticky once dried which is AMAZING!

Pat dry with a towel after applying. I found the lotion is quickly absorbed and the water promptly evaporated so there was very limited need to use the towel.A little goes a long way, so only a small amount is needed to adequately moisturize. And another attribute is the lack of detectable fragrance. What a relief not to juggle soap, shampoo and conditioner along with lotion. This also makes the product suitable for either gender.The product did not leave a greasy film or feel. Instead what remained was the impression of a slightly powdery finish and skin that looked noticeably hydrated. I kept a bottle on my desk and reapplied it to my hands periodically and that method was effective, as well.Note that the product has a long list of ingredients and since sensitivities to particular items are not uncommon it might be worth checking the specifics to at least eliminate known problem components.The pump mechanism has a large platform to depress which is more comfortable to use than the skinny spigots, and another user-friendly design, the bottle has ridges on either side to help create a sure-grip when hands are wet.

When I would scratch, everything got inflamed and bumpy all over again.  This went on for 8 weeks.  I finally received a prescription strength cortisone cream from my dermatologist and tried that for a few weeks, but it made absolutely no difference.  When the cortisone cream did not work, I was very surprised and began to stress out about this ugly itchy rash.  I began googling contact dermatitis/eczema, and I happened to find a reference to this cream.  I was skeptical, but I immediately purchased a jar from Amazon -- I had nothing to lose at this point.  After 2 weeks, the rash almost completely disappeared -- see picture.  I could not believe it.  I kept the jar in my refrigerator as suggested, and every time my arm started to itch, I applied some.  The coolness felt good, but it also tingled a tiny bit and somehow stopped the itching.  Looking at the natural ingredients, I do not understand how the cream works.  I just know that it does.

I came across the name of this cream and decided to give it a try despite the high cost. Let me tell you, this stuff is a godsend miraculous concoction!!! After one night of applying the cream to the affected area the redness was much less, and the bumps shrunk in size. After the 2nd night of treatment the itchy bumps started to completely disappear. Finally we started to see a light at the and of the tunnel after months of unsuccessful treatment!!! After the 3 night the skin of the affected area looked 95% back to normal, no bumps, no flaming red skin just a pink-ish patch the size of a dime. Tonight marks the 4th night I applied the cream to my daughter's face/nose and I can't wait to see her skin in the morning! I am super excited for her!! This was the BEST $30 I have ever spent.

I find myself waking in the middle of the night scratching, often breaking the skin, making it painful in the morning. I finally got fed up and searched ""eczema cure."" This gem caught my eye.

For every purchase I make, I go based off reviews and I hope that my review will help someone that wants an honest answer that might be having troublesome skin problems. Over the past 2 years, I started to develop some type of rashes around my mouth and now along the folds of my nose. My doctor kept prescribing me hydrocortisone cream, nystatin, and a lot of other steroid creams that all it did was make the area burn so much and not diminish. The “rashes” kept getting bigger and bigger. I had to stop using my face moisturizers or anything that had retinol. Face masks were a no because it really burned those areas and make them worse. On some days the area would appear flaky and started to peel. My doctor just gave up on me and didn’t do anything else so I decided to research other creams or causes of what could it possibly be. I found this cream across amazon, and I read someone else’s review which stated she suffered from perioral dermatitis. She provided pictures and the exact same flare ups she had, I had as well. I decided to give it a try and even more because the company has a 180-day get your money back if you’re not satisfied with the product. I mentioned the perioral dermatitis to my doctor, and he prescribed doxycycline hyclate. I have been using the medication and cream for 16 days and I’ve already seen a significant difference! I am really happy with the results I am getting and this cream did not cause me to break out or burn my face at all. It is a bit more on the pricey side but the jar it comes in has a lot of product and you don’t really need a lot. You get your money’s worth! My sister suffers from eczema on her face and I gave her some to try out and it has also helped her a lot!

I think to truly test I should've tried their whole set! However, from the cream alone, I like it. Its consistency is between a gel and a cream, more on a heavy side. I have oily skin, this stuff won't help with the oiliness, I always woke up with a shiny face when using this cream, but as I learned not being too obsessed with the oil on my face, I can see that my skin is well hydrated even after a face wash.

(Probably around May 2017). It was a very affordable great Retinol product with Vitamin E & Provitamin B5 and Green Tea Extract. Retinol was the 8th ingredient in the ingredients list. That was superb because products at the 60USD+ price range does include only that much Retinol. It had also an impressive amount of Green Tea Extract. Green Tea was listed even before the Retinol. They are now listed EVEN AFTER THE PRESERVATIVES! Retinol is the last ingredient. So it actually does not have any! Green Tea,too is listed after 1 of the preservative. So it will not have any effect.It still has Vit.E and Panthenol but that does not make this a Retinol product as claimed!This product is still rated positively at Beautypedia. They probably are not aware of the recent formulation change because their ingredients list shows the previous formula.I bought 2 of this product (I bought the pack of 2 listing but will include this review to every listing of this product so people are aware of this change) and they were delivered today. I was shocked to see the changed formulation. I had been using this product for about 10 years. Will not buy anymore. I can't use a ""RETINOL"" cream which has about 2X parabens than the Retinol!

Moisture I give it a 5/5 and toning the skin i give it a 7/10. I have received a lot of compliments and even my makeup looks better when I apply it. The first week I used it I noticed my skin felt extremely smooth. About  two weeks and a half I noticed the even tones and brighter complexion as well as the moisture on my face.

I feel like I have gotten fast & noticeable results using this on my face and neck in the last two weeks. I ran out of my Alpha Hydrox lotion (which is literally the best you will ever find), and had this laying around. The results in two weeks have been AHmazing! Not that my face was bad to begin with, but my neck was getting gross looking (yeah tanning in your 20's and 30's). I kid you not I was getting really self conscious about this ""ring lines?"" I guess you call them on your neck & this literally made my neck look normal again. Like 90% better in two weeks. I wasn't even looking for results using this. I was just using it without even paying attention. Then I caught myself in the mirror on a few different days & I absolutely cannot believe how much better I look. I never realized how important the care of your neck area was, as well as your face. I wouldn't ever use a higher retinol on my neck area because it tends to be sensitive.

After 3 months of use it ended up in the garbage. I save 1 star reviews for products that have negative effects, but the best thing I can say about this product is that it didn't cause any skin issues.I contacted Neutrogena to ask about the retinol concentration. The firm refused to disclose it (see photo), but after a lot of googling I learned the retinol percentage is 0.025%, one if the lowest ones on the market. The other ingredients are mostly synthetic emolients (fatty alcohols), silicones and parabens, so this cream might cause breakouts if you're acne-prone.If you never used a retinoid before and want to get an inexpensive product to see how your skin reacts, there are better choices out there. The trick is to get a cream that lists its retinol concentration and mixing it with a bland moisturizer (preferably with ceramides). I got RETIN by Skin by POM with .5% retinol and the Phyisiogel Daily Moisture Therapy Cream, and love the results. Decant the mix into a dark/opaque container with an airless pump and start slow. If you're tolerating the ingredient well you can increase the frequency and then move on to a mix with a higher retinol concentration.Rating system:* product damaged my skin** product had no positive or negative effects and ended up in the trash*** product will be used but not repurchased**** product will be repurchased unless I find a better alternative***** product will be definitely repurchased",2.0 out of 5 stars,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71T+9P0-JAL.jpg,oily,oily_B00005K9CK_pid1834_0,https://www.amazon.com/Neutrogena-Healthy-Wrinkle-Retinol-Vitamin/dp/B00005K9CK/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=B00005K9CK&qid=1592523978&sr=8-1,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Y%2BM-5GF0L._SL1500_.jpg

1842,1842,B07KLY4RYG,"Cerave 100% Mineral Sunscreen SPF 50 | Face Sunscreen with Zinc Oxide & Titanium Dioxide for Sensitive Skin | 2.5 oz, 1 Pack","I need all year sun protection so I am always on the lookout for a great sunscreen.  The smell of a sunscreen is important to me and the CeraVe sunscreen is somewhat off-putting when I put it on my face.  It has a sort of chemical or oxy based cleaner type of smell. The formula is thick as to be expected with a sunscreen at 50 but it does not rub in very well even with a thin coat.  It leaves my skin feeling a little bit greasy and white.  My face would look like a mime if I put on an appropriate layer. I was at first really eager to put this on my skin because it has niacinamide and ceramides and that is awesome to have included in a daily lotion.  Then I learned that some of the ingredients can be a bit hazardous.  I did not know what the ingredients were and why there was a cause for concern but I looked up a few.  It confuses me a little bit that vitamin A is in this because I thought this caused sun sensitivity.  Methylisothiazolinone is a preservative but has been found to cause allergic reactions and has been found to be neurotoxic in mammals. The other ingredients have concern but are mild. My recommendation for improvement would be to change the preservative if possible.  The formula does not smell right and after I used it the first time I did not find myself wanting to use it again or continue to use it.  I looked up the ingredients and dug a little deeper into the formula.  I have not tossed the container but am hesitant to apply it and that is not ideal for a sunscreen.  I will still wear this for sun protection but for the future, I will look for another formula.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/6128CIKffiL.jpg,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61FITbbf4uL.jpg",oily,"oily_B07KLY4RYG_pid1842_0,oily_B07KLY4RYG_pid1842_1",https://www.amazon.com/Mineral-Sunscreen-Titanium-Dioxide-Sensitive/dp/B07KLY4RYG/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=B07KLY4RYG&qid=1592523958&sr=8-1,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71JYNyLOFvL._SL1500_.jpg

I honestly didn't notice any change (about 3 weeks) until my aunt mentioned how great my skin looked. I did a side by side photo with the same time of day and lighting (sunlight) to show you the difference.Although subtle, I can start seeing the difference already.  My skin is brighter, softer, and fine lines are starting to disappear. I have lived with PCOS for most of my life and been dealing with the horrible acne it. I did break out initially but concluded it was just adjusting.  My skin has cleared up tremendously now and during ""that time"" I can honestly say it wasn't as bad as it usually is.I place a dropper full into my cupped hand and use my fingers to dab it around my eyes (including my hoods) and btn my brows, the rest I spread btn two hands and pat onto my neck. I use another dropper full to pat onto the rest of my face. There is a slight odor when you first put it on but goes away as soon as it dries. Three weeks and I still have plenty of product left. I use this along with their Retinol Moisturizer.I couldn't be happier and am a lifetime user now. I highly recommend this product. I know everyone has different skin, but for the price why not give it a try. Even my mom bought some immediately after seeing my results.I hope this review has been helpful.

Let's really talk here. I received my product about a week and a half ago. I do not appreciate quick reviews saying just how the product feels and all. We purchase these products because we want to see a difference, real results and without a review discussing that, it's worthless. So I am almost in my second week of using the product and I can only comment on my current experience and, as I often do in my reviews, I will return in several weeks with an update on how the product actually WORKS.So, for now I can say I like the texture. It's thin but not really *watery* in that you can tell it has some substance to it. As you pat it on, you can feel a slight silicone-like glide to the product. I like that. I experienced a tiny bit of stinging the first time I used it but that's because I put it on right after washing my face. Now, I wait a few minutes until my face has dried a bit and then apply. No stinging or problems at all. I will be posting some photos of me currently and then several weeks later on my ""problem areas"" - cheeks mostly from teenage acne many years ago. I am 48 years old and have no wrinkles to speak of so not expecting anything there. But I have used vitamin C serums before, most notably the one by Avon many years ago before they discontinued it and I loved it. Skin gets more dewy and even toned and I am expecting the same with this product.So far, so good.To be fair (because I like to see before and after photos) here are a few pics of my face CLOSE UP today. I'm really already seeing improvement. I am also using this on my neck so I want you to see that as well. A couple months I will return with updated photos to see what's really going on. I've already set up a reminder in Wunderlist so yes, I really will be back. And keep in mind, closeup photos suck because we get to see ourselves the way the general public doesn't. In the supermarket, for instance, you'd never be this close. So I had to include one cute photo just so you see that I'm not hideous in general - LOL!UPDATE 3/24/2016The review above was on February 13, 2016 and I'm back. See photos in white shirt below. While I'm not sure yet how much improvement there is on my face, I do see results on my neck. I tried to get a photo in sunlight but shadow kept interfering so there are 2 new photos with the white shirt. Hope you can see it well enough compared to the first picture of my neck (that came out sideways) where you can see the bottom of my phone case. Now in fairness, the improvement may be simply because in addition to applying twice a day, I'm also paying more attention and massaging in moisturizer after each application of the Vitamin C serum. Still, not bad for just over 30 days. I'm about 1/3 through the bottle so it lasts well and I really think I use a bit more than I probably need to. I don't so much rub it in as I put about 5 drops in my palm then pat it directly onto my forehead, 3 more drops for each cheek, 6 or more for neck (all the way around), and then I dot some on bridge of my nose and chin. Pretty much my whole face, avoiding eyes as Vitamin C can be drying.Will be back with updates and more photos, too. That's how I review products.
