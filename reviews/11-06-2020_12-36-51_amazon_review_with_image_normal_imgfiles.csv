1,1,B01N9SPQHQ,"La Roche-Posay Toleriane Double Repair Face Moisturizer, Oil-Free Face Cream with Niacinamide","I used to use Physiogel lotion and cream both typesAnd recently was looking for a replacement just bc I wanted to try something new.Then found this! I heard a lot of good things about this brand already so it was an easy decision.I have acne-prone, sensitive, oily (but extremly dry on some areas on my face) skin, so it is hard to find products that are just right for me.This cream was delivered in a decent condition, the box was clean and with no damage, but one thing not really satisfying is the tube was not sealed.It has very creamy texture, not watery at all, as you can see in the pictures I’ve attached.And the size of the product is actually bigger than I thought it would be-attached a picture of it next to Aveeno hand cream to compare the size.When I tried it on my face, there was no irritation at all, no burning or stinging feelings.It is not greasy at all, but still moisturizing enough that I can feel it right after one application.I am very satisfied with this purchase, and willing to buy another one after this.I’m so happy that I ordered it to use for the cold and dry weather we are having.I highly recommend this facial moisturizer for anybody who is looking for one that is not too overwhelming but still moisturizing enough :)",5.0 out of 5 stars,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Hr05eNPrL.jpg,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71RA6ObLM-L.jpg,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/813jrD80KXL.jpg",normal,"normal_B01N9SPQHQ_pid1_0,normal_B01N9SPQHQ_pid1_1,normal_B01N9SPQHQ_pid1_2",https://www.amazon.com/CeraVe-Moisturizing-Lotion-Hyaluronic-Fragrance/dp/B07RK4HST7/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=B07RK4HST7&qid=1592511881&sr=8-1,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51YT4dO6bfL._SL1000_.jpg

3,3,B01N9SPQHQ,"La Roche-Posay Toleriane Double Repair Face Moisturizer, Oil-Free Face Cream with Niacinamide","There I was.It was a Tuesday, mid October, 2018. I’m pacing Walgreens skin care aisle, reading labels up & down. Sweaty & hormonal, pregnant & confused.There she was; the esthetician angel hired by Walgreens. She approaches me.“How can I help you?” I look at her, she looks at me. She must be in her 60s? But her skin looks flawless. (Seriously do pores just disappear at her age?) She doesn’t even have wrinkles, except for some beautifully placed smile lines.“Sure,” I mumble; clearly disheartened. “My face is freaking out. I’ve spent $100+ these last few months trying to fix it. I’ve never had an issue-before this pregnancy- & I don’t know what’s wrong with my skin!” I continue to vent hormonally, “Breaking out, greasy one moment & dry & flaky the next-“She nods her head up & down as I speak, eyes shimmering in understanding behind her rimless glasses. She’s been here before.“Have you tried La Roche moisturizer? It’s probiotic thermal water works miracles.”I haven’t of course.My fairy godmother (for who else could this angel be?) hands me the unsuspecting bottle. $20 dollars? I scoff inwardly at the high price tag, not fully understanding yet what a gift this is.SPF or no spf? (It doesn’t matter I later find out, they both were made by the beautiful witches of the west & represent it.)It worked that very night. My face literally healed in 24 hours. (Read the back of the bottle. It does what it says)18 months later, I’m on my 5th bottle. My face is supple, even, and I barely wear makeup. (cc cream by it, & that’s it.)It’s magical. Whats in this bottle? Sorcery perhaps?“ANY SUFFICIENTLY ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY IS INDISTINGUISHABLE FROM MAGIC”My only wish is it came in a bigger bottle.*ive added a photo with myself wearing it cc cream, but you can see my face looks lovely.

Typically my face would be nice and oily, so I would never need moisturizer, but I guess that all changes, too, since I have been getting older. The problem is, and just like my 66-year-old mother, she gets oily skin. And there have been times where I have accumulated a couple pimples here and there, every so often from using this moisturizer.I mean, my skin looks a lot more radiant, but just watch out, because if you don’t have extremely dry skin, then it could pose problems on the pimple level.Edit:June 2019 I have been using this now for the past couple months, and I can say, I love the fact that it protects me from the sun, it also gives me a glow, during times when my skin is completely dry from using soaps to clean my face.

28,28,B000YJ2SLG,CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion | 12 Ounce | Face & Body Lotion for Dry Skin with Hyaluronic Acid | Fragrance Free,"Just want to let everyone know that the cerave lotion on the left is one I bought from cvs, and the one on the right is the large one from amazon, and you can clearly see that they put hyaluronic acid lower on the list for the amazon one, vs the cvs one. And just in case you don't know, ingredients for any products go in order from the greatest amounts first, and descend to lower amounts as you go down the list. The cvs one has hyaluronic acid much higher on the list, and the packaging looks completely different too! Like, why?? Does cerave make a cheaper version of their products for amazon, vs other retailers?? And that is just really annoying, aggravating, and upsetting to me. Why water it down to buy it for a cheaper price? No one wants that. Everyone wants to get what they pay for. For sure, the one from cvs was much pricier ($17) for the smaller bottle size, while the amazon one was like, $12 when I got it for the large, 19 oz one. But I just want to say that I KNOW what I'm paying for!! If its a cheaper price for a more watered down product, I'm not going to get it!! Just leave the products the way that they are. And I have to say that yes, the textures between them were NOTICEABLY different! The one from cvs was definitely more opaque and creamier, while as soon as I got the amazon one, I immediately immediately noticed, without a doubt, a more watery consistency. Um, barf. Never going to buy this product from amazon again because of how they're so blatantly cheating!

I came across this while looking for a lotion that works best for Non-oily skin, a daily lotion, for sensitive-ish skin, i found the PERFECT one with this.I bought this about 2 weeks ago, was shipped in 2 days, & when i received it nothing was wrong with the packaging or bottle. Anyways, I started using this after i decided to switch from my Neutrogena Oil-Free Moisture which i had been using for about 6 months. I do not have naturally Oily Skin so it was too drying. But with maaaaany hours spent looking for a FACE lotion with good reviews I came across this and let me just say IT IS WORTH THE MONEY, I am in love! works for face and body which i was skeptical about at first but i do not regret my purchase at all and i highly highly reccomend anyone purchase this.

I guess that’s the hyaluronic acid doing it’s job.This lotion is lightweight and doesn’t leave me feeling greasy. It also doesn’t have much of a scent which I count as a plus. Best of all my skin isn’t breaking out or changing in any negative way.Although this product is touted as face and body lotion I have yet to use it on my face.

I then use the lotion (on the right) for my chest, arms, hands, and face/neck.Note: don’t think this alone is going to give you skin that you could bounce a quarter off of. You still need to do exercise to strengthen the muscle and tighten the skin. This works as a SUPPLEMENT to losing weight and cellulite that can result from that weight loss. Or, for aging skin to help appear younger.It also smells great, not too strong but still a delightful smell. Would definitely buy again and recommend.",5.0 out of 5 stars,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71H7OkNI0hL.jpg,normal,normal_B003CJP13W_pid49_0,https://www.amazon.com/CeraVe-Moisturizing-Lotion-Hyaluronic-Fragrance/dp/B07RK4HST7/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=B07RK4HST7&qid=1592511881&sr=8-1,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51YT4dO6bfL._SL1000_.jpg

58,58,B00DG8EZY0,NIVEA Original Daily Moisture Body Lotion - 48 Hour Moisture For Normal To Dry Skin - 16.9 fl. oz. Pump Bottle,"Hi, it's Glamorous Gem, hope you all are having a fantastic day.Anyway, I just wanted to take a little time out of my day to say a couple of things about this lotion.I, unfortunately, switched to this lotion a couple of weeks ago because my Vaseline Advance Repair ran out and I refused to go to another store. This one had a great size and it was on sale so I got it just to try something new.Scent -The scent on this reminds me of deodorant and a cheap powder smelling one at that. I mean, I know they tried to make it smell like it had a clean and fresh scent, but it smells like I rolled in deodorant rather than taking a shower. It is not a pleasant smell at all.Richness and Lather -I bought this one because it says its richness would compare to the Essentially Enriched and it certainly does not. I mean, it does last after you take a shower that day, but not longer. Your skin starts to feel dry and rubbery after just a couple of hours.Overall Feel and Reapplying - Now, I have dry and sensitive skin. I loved Vaseline because it gives you all the moisture for an extended amount of time and its lotion was naturally hypoallergenic and this one does not compare to its claims.My skin was very dryer and worse than before when using this lotion. It has a watered down thickness that makes it messy to apply and it cakes upon reapplying. I felt like my skin was clogged up and dirty compared to fresh and clean with my previous lotion.I felt like it did absolutely nothing to my skin other than aggravate my skin irritations such as atopic dermatitis and eczema. IT IS ABSOLUTELY NOT FOR SENSITIVE SKIN SUFFERERS AT ALL.I agree with another consumer that this product has parabens and those that are more worse for your skin after extended use. Methylparaben and Ethylparaben are very harmful and aggravate tons of skin.I thought I could love this product, but sadly it was a miserable one and I wish I would have just gone somewhere else. It fits nowhere, but the trash. Maybe Nivea might make a better product in the future, but sadly they can consider this a fail and I will not purchase again.Note: This is not promotional content.

I'm very fair skinned, covered in scars, and can't tan naturally. I decided to test this lotion on one leg to see how it would develop, how long it took to develop, and what would take it off the skin.I saw results the day I put it on and it looked like a natural tan. I then tried different products to take it off to make sure I wouldn't look like a splotchy mess if I used makeup remover or face wash. The only product I found that will remove minimum about of the product is rubbing alcohol. So, makeup remover and Neutrogena exfoliating face wash is safe!!For the scars. My scars are HUGE. Naturally my scars will stay a shade lighter if I go into the sun. Same case with this lotion; so it looks natural. All my mini scars tanned along with my skin.Notes to equally as fair skinned people: if may clump up into little crystals you're probably rubbing too hard. Remember your underarms/ back of the arm, neck, and inside the bellybutton (guess who missed it). Wait till you go to bed to do the hands so you don't end up washing all of it off and your hands don't match your arms.I put the lotion on two days in a row and then waited about 2-3 days to put another layer on.

I was nervous about it since I am so fair. I have yet to meet a single person who has ben more fair than myself. People usually could ID me at a distance by my legs. I love my fair skin and I won’t go tanning as skin cancer runs in the family. But I really just wanted a nice glow. And this really did the trick. Looks like I’ve been outside enjoying the weather. I just got the face moisturizer too and am excited to try.It moisturizes my legs well. I will say it does leave me feeling a bit of a residue and the smell is a little strong for my liking. But I’m not used to wearing anything scented. It’s not bad or overwhelming. Just kinda gets old.Firming I have get to see. Honestly I don’t think it’ll do anything. Cellulite is what it is.Tanning part is great. Did streak and look a little patchy day one. But made sure I applied evenly. Did it two times a day for three days and already I look like a living creature and not the undead.Will say I forgot to apply to backs of my hands and my feet.

It's flattering on many skin types.. I have friends of all ages and skin tones who turn to this product and have all gotten positive results. The product says it's a gradual tan but I see immediate effects. There is minimum streaking, but make sure to put lotion on darker areas that you do not want to tan (such as knees) and make sure to wash your hands thoroughly after application. What I like most about this product is that it's not an orange tan, it's more of a natural bronze. The only thing I could think of to dislike is I'm not exactly sure if the ""firming"" aspect of this lotion actually works.. maybe it works different on everyone, but I haven't seen any immediate results.PROS: Great price, natural bronze color (not orange), compliments many skin tones, little to no streakingCONS: Not sure if the ""firming"" works as advertisedIf you have found this review helpful, please vote ""yes"" :)",5.0 out of 5 stars,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/7135UFu1thL.jpg,normal,normal_B001UTK76C_pid120_0,https://www.amazon.com/CeraVe-Moisturizing-Lotion-Hyaluronic-Fragrance/dp/B07RK4HST7/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=B07RK4HST7&qid=1592511881&sr=8-1,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51YT4dO6bfL._SL1000_.jpg

It smells amazing, although if you use too much of it ,you do notice it has the smell of self tanner but I also applied the tanner to my whole body, so it could've just been me lol but it does smell better than a lot of other products I've tried.

Past sunscreens I used were usually greasy, thick, hard to spread, and left a white cast – not this one! It is very light and easy to spread. Since it is easy to spread, I have found that I can re-apply it even after I put make-up on; I re-apply it carefully and it doesn’t mess up my make-up too much. Also, it doesn’t even feel like I am using sunscreen when I have it on and I regularly use it under my make-up. It has a faint lemon-y scent, but it goes away within a few minutes. Right after applying it, the product may leave a slight shine on your skin, but that also disappears after a few minutes.

Based off what I’ve read on Reddit, this product has alcohol in it which helps the product dry quickly and feel light.

153,153,B0071XPQQ2,"CeraVe SA Lotion for Rough & Bumpy Skin | 8 Ounce | Vitamin D, Hyaluronic Acid, Salicylic Acid & Lactic Acid Lotion | Fragrance Free","After having tried both Cerave and Amlactin, which are not identical products, but seem like they're basically built to do the same thing, I can say that Cerave is the hand's down winner for a variety of reasons.  Despite the fact that it takes longer to see results, Cerave wins due to texture, scent, and overall feel.  I tried really hard to like Amlactin for over a year, but it feels and smells gross compared to Cerave.SKIN SMOOTHING POWER:  Cerave takes a little longer to see results, but there is less irritation.  With Amlactin, I would frequently get itchy, and sometimes get tiny irritated bumps, which were not acne, but could resemble bad skin if scratched.  If you have severe KP, you might want to try both, and even alternate them, but I could not be happier to ditch the Amlactin, so I'll take slow progress over gross feel and smell.SCENT:  Cerave is truly odorless.  In comparison, Amlactin smells sour, and the bad smell lingers for at least an hour or two depending on how much you use.  Not great if you need to use it on your face!  But Cerave has no scent whatsoever.  I can use it on my face and under makeup without issues.TEXTURE:  Cerave and Amlactin appear to have the same pudding-like texture, but Cerave is easier to apply, because it sinks in quicker.  Amlactin leaves skin greasy.  If you applied Amlactin to your feet, you wouldnt be able to walk across a hardwood floor for at least 15-20 minutes unless you put socks/slippers on.MOISTURIZING POWER:  Amlactin in the winner if you are looking for heavy moisture.  But Cerave is the winner if you want clean-feeling moisture.  After applying Cerave, my skin feels lightly hydrated, but then again I don't have extremely dry skin, just skin that fails to slough off nicely.  Since I am oily on my face, I prefer Cerave, because it doesnt make my face feel unpleasantly greasy.PRICE:  Both Amlactin and Cerave work out to be about the same price for the same amount of product.  They both range from $12-15 for an 8oz bottle, so if you can get either one for under $13, you are getting a decent price.BOTTOM LINE:  If moisture is your top priority, and you can stand the gross smell and feel, Amlactin is still worth checking out for KP sufferers.  But if you value clean moisture and a light feeling on the skin, and are willing to wait a little longer for results, Cerave is much, much easier to bear, in my opinion.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/5123ckDemaL.jpg,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51GAIt3eSNL.jpg,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51ic0kH-LyL.jpg",normal,"normal_B0071XPQQ2_pid153_0,normal_B0071XPQQ2_pid153_1,normal_B0071XPQQ2_pid153_2",https://www.amazon.com/CeraVe-Moisturizing-Lotion-Hyaluronic-Fragrance/dp/B07RK4HST7/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=B07RK4HST7&qid=1592511881&sr=8-1,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51YT4dO6bfL._SL1000_.jpg

I purposely chose the original scent as it's what I grew up on and had never had a problem with it. Apparently there have been some changes.  I'll never buy this brand of lotion again.Buyer beware.

I ran out and saw this on sale.  It was my mistake to just assume they were essentially the same. They were except a few major ingredients! My skin kept getting more and more inflammed, deeper painful knobs were coming up.  I was wondering if I had eaten something.  It just wasn't stopping.  One night I was actually in hives down my chin to my neck!  Later I noticed that I was getting what looked to be just plain cysts..pure inflammation no whitehead or anything.  I was pulling my hair out like what is happening.  I decided to take a look at the ingredients in this imposter. Talc and titanium dioxide... Really!? Who does that? I quick washed it off and ordered Eradikate my normal drying lotion, express shipping.  I will NEVER do that again.

225,225,B0017SWIU4,"Mario Badescu Drying Lotion, 1 Fl Oz","All of the reviews on this product were SO mixed it seriously made me hesitate getting it because of how many things can apparently go wrong. So I flipped a coin lol and decided to purchase this item that I had high hopes for and I don’t regret it. Shipping was fast and came within 4-5 days. My lil jar came in a small bubble wrapped zip lock bag and was also surrounded by bubble wrap in the box it was shipped in, so it did not come broken like I feared. It did come shaken of course but just leaving it for a good hour or two did the trick :). When I finally tried the product it was amazing! I feared the results of some people where their acne or breakouts got worse but thankfully this did not happen to me. This product definitely reduced redness and helped push up the impurity to take it out effortlessly. Many were frustrated that this product came off in the night on their pillow but I will admit this product takes self control haha especially for a wiggly worm like myself. Depending on where I have the product I will only let myself sleep on one side or if I have it on varying spots I just stay on my back. When I did forget and moved everywhere causing it to come off the results weren’t as good as when I stayed still and allowed the product to do its thing. Overall I’m in love with this product and definitely will repurchase!! I’m glad I took the risk and if your someone wanting to get this product but aren’t sure,I recommend physically buying it to spend less if you get different results.

In the winter, when I take off my skinny jeans, I can actually see tiny skin flakes all over the inside of my jeans - this is how dry my skin is. I have tried many body creams and I do like a few. The one that helped me get rid of all the comedones on my thigh is The Body Shop vitamin E body cream (I can't use any acid peel because of my sensitive skin). The one that helps instantly with cracking/peeling heels is L'occitane almond body lotion, but neither really stopped flaking of my leg skin. I have used Eucerin Intensive Repair and it does help, but I really hate the sticky texture and the smell is weird..it's not strong, but enough to repel me. This Curel hydra therapy not only stopped flaking of my leg skin, it also makes my skin feels so smooth. It is a lot lighter compared to the Eucerin Intensive Repair and rubs in very quickly. It is supposed to be applied when skin is still wet, but it takes longer to absorb if applied wet. I usually apply it after towel dry, and it still does the job. It has a very subtle orange smell (from orange peel I believe) which is delightful. I even decanted it into small bottles so I can carry it around to use as a hand cream.

Helps to Repair Moisture Barrier","This is good stuff! No heavy scent or thick hard to rub in goopey feel to it.  A lotion created to be put on when your skin is wet, it glides on easily and is absorbed fairly quickly without much of a sticky residue. It can be used on dry skin as well of course, but it really is best used when you are damp out of the shower when your skin's pores are open and ready to accept the lotion.This package contains (4) 12 ounce bottles, making each one around six dollars.  Initially that price seemed a tad spendy to me, until I saw how well it worked.The lotion left my skin feeling smooth and hydrated, and this lasted for several hours post shower. **Pat yourself dry after applying for the best results versus rubbing with a towel.** Certain areas (elbows and knees) appeared drier sooner than other areas, but a reapplication to dry skin took care of that problem. The lotion is very concentrated, so whether using it wet or dry I needed very little to get the desired effect.  I did avoid putting this on my face during the day as it appeared somewhat greasy and wasn't the look I was going for with my mineral based matte make-up.I did use it at night after washing my face in place of my usual nightly moisturizer and it worked well. Wherever it is used it seems to create a moisturizing layer to the skin that acts as a barrier of sorts. I noticed it most on my hands when after applying the lotion hours later washing my hands and having them feel moisturized while washing instead of dry afterwards. Definitely seems to work best with continued use, but even with one application it's noticable.Overall, I think this is an excellent product for the whole family.

Helps to Repair Moisture Barrier","I have used other in shower moisturizers, but this here is my first time using Curel hydratherapy. I got a tube as a sample from Crowdtap and so I wanted to give it a try and see how it worked compared to others that I have used. The moisturizer does not really have to much of a smell at all. Actually I do not think it has any smell at all. Even though there is no scent it worked extremely better than I thought, and that is fine with me. I do have really dry skin, so finding a good moisturizer is hard for me. So when I find a good one I try to stick with it! I have eczema so my skin changes with the season so I was really happy when getting a chance to try this out. Curel has some really great products so I just knew that this wet skin moisturizer would be nothing less then the best.I have been using for about a week now  everyday and I have noticed a difference in my skin and the way it feels. Fall is here and well going into winter and my skin changes almost for the worst. It gets very dry sometimes no matter how much moisturizer I use. It really just depends on the day and the heat. I use other great body washes that have kept my skin feeling wonderful after a shower but then I'd have to put on an additional moisturizer. When using this I noticed that it didn't take long to soak into my skin at all. Another major plus is that my  skin did'nt feel all extra sticky once dried which is AMAZING! My skin didn't feel heavy at all afterwards, I really like this and it has marked its spot in my skin care routine!➽➽I RECEIVED THIS CUREL SAMPLE COMPLIMENTARY OF CROWDTAP TO TRY FOR TESTING PURPOSES AT A DISCOUNT, THIS DOES NOT IN ANYWAY AFFECT MY OPINION OF THE PRODUCT, ALL OPINIONS ABOVE ARE THAT OF MY OWN➽➽",5.0 out of 5 stars,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71-dNewVc8L.jpg,normal,normal_B07DQX9B7G_pid316_0,https://www.amazon.com/CeraVe-Moisturizing-Lotion-Hyaluronic-Fragrance/dp/B07RK4HST7/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=B07RK4HST7&qid=1592511881&sr=8-1,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51YT4dO6bfL._SL1000_.jpg

Helps to Repair Moisture Barrier","Applying lotion on wet skin is something I have done for years although the in-shower lotions, the ones that are to be applied and then rinsed off in the shower have largely left me unimpressed and often with a greasy shower to clean.But this product is simply to be used after showering while skin is still damp. Pat dry with a towel after applying. I found the lotion is quickly absorbed and the water promptly evaporated so there was very limited need to use the towel.A little goes a long way, so only a small amount is needed to adequately moisturize. And another attribute is the lack of detectable fragrance. What a relief not to juggle soap, shampoo and conditioner along with lotion. This also makes the product suitable for either gender.The product did not leave a greasy film or feel. Instead what remained was the impression of a slightly powdery finish and skin that looked noticeably hydrated. I kept a bottle on my desk and reapplied it to my hands periodically and that method was effective, as well.Note that the product has a long list of ingredients and since sensitivities to particular items are not uncommon it might be worth checking the specifics to at least eliminate known problem components.The pump mechanism has a large platform to depress which is more comfortable to use than the skinny spigots, and another user-friendly design, the bottle has ridges on either side to help create a sure-grip when hands are wet.

I've had this cream for about 2 weeks now and I really love it. I am a college student so i'm constantly running around outside from building to building and living in new york it gets pretty cold.For a man such as myself, I've undermined the importance of daily skin care for a long time but recently I've gone further to protect my skin, because why not keep your skin healthy and lively. Whether you think so or not, having healthy skin will improve your daily quality of life. People are sure to notice the difference, and will definitely improve your self esteem. Bright, Soft, Healthy skin is good all year round!.This cream smells amazing!. Me and my mother both use this, and we both love it. just a small dab of it is enough for both my arms, hands and my face. I have definitely felt the difference on my skin after using this the past two weeks. My face feels much softer and looks better. It lasts all day and has become part of my daily routine before leaving the house. The bottle is bigger than i expected so i'm sure it will last me a couple months of use. I will be sure to update this review when it has run out and how my skin is doing after a couple of months.Overall I would definitely recommend this cream to anyone, man or woman, to include in your daily skin care, or even as a gift to a friend.

Retin-A cream can be really harsh, so I initially only used it for my body acne and not my face. Eventually I started using a tiny amount a few times a week to help my remaining facial acne as the birth control continued to clear it and to help smooth some wrinkles and maybe fade my acne scars. However, I was still using St. Ives apricot scrub with salicylic acid and some roc retinol cream a few nights a week also. Add in some time in the sun with no sunblock, and I ended up with a terribly burned face. This, along with the dryness from a Colorado fall/early winter made my skin extremely dry and painful. I couldn't even apply moisturizer without it burning. Needless to say, I had to stop using any face wash. The dryness also started to make my skin break out, and I couldn't treat it with anything. After desperately googling remedies for my dry skin and forming acne, I started using a mixture of tea tree, argan, jojoba, rose hip, and sometimes castor oil on my face along with frequent honey masks. This fixed my dry skin, which store bought moisturizers for extremely dry skin couldn't do, but I still had terrible acne, like the worst I've ever had in my life. I started using a bar of Cerave moisturizing soap because it was on clearance at walmart for like $1 and I'd heard of people using it for acne. This helped to make my face feel cleaner, but it didn't really help my acne. I knew I needed something that could exfoliate my skin, but there was no way I was going to use something as harsh as the St. Ives scrub again. I decided to try this because I did like the Cerave bar soap even though it didn't help my acne, and this has at least some salycilic acid for exfoliation. When I first used it, I didn't think it was really going to help my acne because the consistency is so smooth and it doesn't seem like it could really exfoliate. However, after 1-2 weeks, I started to notice my skin clearing up. Slowly but surely, this face wash helped to almost completely clear my skin. I had also started taking my birth control more regularly, added a probiotic supplement, and started using vitamin c on my face, so I can't say this is the only thing that helped my acne, but it certainly contributed a lot. I also eventually started using an electric face brush to help exfoliate, and I think that could've helped. I still get acne around my period, and because I'm a college senior, so I'm always super stressed, don't get enough sleep, and don't always eat right. Also, you can't tell from the pictures, but I have quite a few blackheads on my nose. The face wash has helped clear some of those and make them smaller, but I have yet to find a product that actually completely gets rid of them, and I've tried many. Even with the blackheads, my skin is so much better now. This face wash saved my skin, and I think it's worth every penny!Pictures:Picture 1- The right side is a picture from February 14, 2017 without any makeup after starting my oil treatment. The left side is from April 7, 2017 with makeup, but you can still see how awful my skin was. I didn't start using the face wash until around the end of April.Picture 2- The left part is from July 7, 2017, and the two on the right are both from July 17, 2017. I am wearing makeup in all of these pictures, but you can tell that my skin had improved significantly. Few pimples, but lots of acne scars from the breakout.Picture 3- Both were taken August 21, 2017 with make up. Once again you can see I don't have many pimples, just terrible acne scars.Picture 4- The left part was taken December 12, 2017. I was testing a BB cream, so it is cover the bottom half of my face, but you can see that my skin looks pretty clear. The top right side was taken December 13 with the BB cream on my entire face. The bottom right picture was taken today with no makeup. As I said previously, I still get pimples from stress and periods, but they are usually small and mild instead of the giant lumps I was getting before, and they go away really quickly using cosrx pimple patches (definitely check those out) and vitamin c serum. Also, please note that I do have freckles, so most of the spots on my face are just freckles or dark marks from old acne I am still trying to get rid of. Sorry for the long review, and all the pictures with makeup (I didn't take many without makeup when my skin was that bad), but I hope it helped!",5.0 out of 5 stars,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61-h08fC8aL.jpg,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61IWPqbv+OL.jpg,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61kir8eR3lL.jpg,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61p72FQahFL.jpg",normal,"normal_B00U1YCRD8_pid339_0,normal_B00U1YCRD8_pid339_1,normal_B00U1YCRD8_pid339_2,normal_B00U1YCRD8_pid339_3",https://www.amazon.com/CeraVe-Moisturizing-Lotion-Hyaluronic-Fragrance/dp/B07RK4HST7/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=B07RK4HST7&qid=1592511881&sr=8-1,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51YT4dO6bfL._SL1000_.jpg

Again, this is only 7 days between photos, so it’s still in progress but I already love it!

The results are paying off for me so I will continue using! There are no smell that I can pick up on this and it feels clean! The SA cream if you use after the wash is thick but I use it sparingly.

369,369,B00352MHE2,"Cetaphil Daily Advance Ultra Hydrating Lotion With Shea Butter For Dry, Sensitive Skin, 16 Fl Oz (Pack of 1)","A good, heavier body moisturizer. Cetaphil's current packaging shows it is the ""middle"" of their lineup.Here in the mid-Atlantic (with our humid summers), I use it mostly during winter cold snaps, and use Cetaphil's lighter ""All Skin Types"" most of the time. Those of you living in dry climates might find it useful year around. The ingredient list is similar to that lighter lotion, but swaps the avocado oil for macadamia nut oil, and adds shea butter.The lotion is moderately heavy, you can feel it on your skin (likely the shea butter), and if you wash your hands too soon, you'll notice the slickness. I'm not a fan of this weight of lotion normally since it gets on things, and I don't want to pet my cats with it on my hands. But if you're suffering from dry skin or chapping, this is the way to go. And it's not particularly heavy or greasy compared to other heavier lotions I've tried.The odorless is worth extra praise. Manufacturers today seem to fill most products with cloying, overwhelming scents. As a typical male, I'm not really interested in my lotion (or me) smelling like cheap perfume. Worse, many synthetic scent compounds are implicated as health hazards. So an unscented lotion is the only way to go for me. Kudos for Cetaphil doing that across their product line.The packaging changes occasionally (including since last year), but the ingredients seem to stay the same. The current product photo here isn't the new packaging, so I've included a pic of it here.This is my go-to lotion during excessively dry spells.

388,388,B000052YOX,"Neutrogena Oil-Free Facial Moisturizer, Sensitive Skin, 4 Fl Oz","My wife had been buying a facial moisturizer from another brand that I had been using which I liked since it was scent free and seemed to disappear on your face and not leave you with that shiny look. It was not cheap but it did the job. Well they decided to reformulate it and put it in a smaller tube and although they said it was scent free still, It now seemed to have a more flowery oder which I did not care for. So I began searching for a new one and it lead me to this product. Been using it for about 3 months now and I would have to say I really like it. Has no odor, does not leave you with that shiny look and keeps my face nice and hydrated. Love the dispenser with its pump top. 3 pumps and I have the perfect amount for me. This should help the bottle last longer as each use is consistent. Seems to last awhile as well and the price is pretty good when comparing it to what I was using. Also I have had no issues with any kind of skin breakouts so it seems to be pretty friendly to that. Just a really nice gentle all around facial moisturizer.

I have sensitive skin combination skin and really can only wash my face with water. I’d like to point out I don’t wear foundation and am not wearing any in this photo. I’ve always had a hard time finding a moisturizer that wasn’t too oily but actually worked and didn’t break my skin out.

396,396,B077TQR6ZW,CeraVe Face Moisturizer with SPF 30 | 1.7 Ounce | Light-Weight Face Lotion with Hyaluronic Acid | Packaging May Vary,"I LOVE this face lotion - it's great for my [very] oily skin because it's so light and mattifying yet provides SPF 30. For anyone with greasy skin who is looking for a great product with spf they can wear under their makeup every day without looking like their face is dripping wet by noon (due to oiliness), PLEASE GIVE THIS LOTION A TRY! You won't regret it. Make sure you purchase the ""Ultra Light Moisturizer for Normal to Oily Skin"" in the 1.7 oz bottle. CeraVe makes a myriad of face lotions and this one is absolutely incredible. Living (and aging) in Southern California, I've been on a 10 year-long mission to find the perfect balance of a non-greasy face lotion with great SPF coverage that I can use daily, either alone or under makeup. I was randomly given a sample of this and I cannot put into words how amazed I was after the first day of use. I still need my oil blotters throughout the day, but my face doesn't feel like it has a 1-inch layer of Crisco on its surface after being at work for less than an hour.Also, a heads-up to anyone scrolling through these reviews: I've noticed some 1-star comments, however after seeing the specific bottle size and product name at the top of each comment, I soon came to realize that about half of the comments for this product (the ""Ultra Light Moisturizer for Normal to Oily Skin SPf 30"" are erroneously referring to various other CeraVe face lotions - many are referring to the ""CeraVe AM face lotion"" or the ""CeraVe PM face lotion,"" both of which come in a 3 oz bottle and shouldn't be confused with the ""Ultra Light Moisturizer for Normal to Oily skin, 30 SPF - 1.7 oz bottle"" lotion. It's kind of a bummer because this product would probably have a much higher star rating if so many folks hadn't written poor reviews for the wrong items on this product's page. So if you're trying to get a good understanding of THIS product, please disregard all of the reviews for the ""CeraVe AM (or PM) Lotion, 3-oz,"" since those are both completely different face moisturizers from what this comment section is supposed to be about. I even saw photos of the wrong lotion type in the section where people are supposed to post pictures of the product being reviewed. I'm including a picture of the CORRECT product; hopefully that will help lessen any confusion. Sorry for the rant but I just wanted to point this problem out - I was surprised to see any poor reviews and then realized the customers writing about bad experiences were often complaining about a totally different lotion than the product at hand.I have tried (and been disappointed by) so many SPF face lotions - expensive brands, inexpensive brands, and everything in between. Once I found this heavenly product, I was truly elated. It's great for oily skin and feels so light and nourishing - my skin always feels smooth and soft after applying it.It's also much less expensive on Amazon - I was at CVS last night and they are charging about $7 more per bottle. I love Amazon and I love this product. Protecting your skin from the sun on a daily basis is very important and should be a priority for everyone. This is a wonderful, high-quality SPF moisturizer and you should definitely give it a try.

400,400,B00N2Y7VI0,"Moisturizing Lotion HP - Protective Moisturiser: Protects skin from Pollution, Dryness, Metals. Proven Effectiveness. Safe & Pure Formulation. Sensitive, Irritated (Eczema, Acne.), Reactive skin","I was a bit surprised at the size of the bottle when it came. I should have known since it's just under 7 oz, but it was a bit smaller than expected.There are some really nice aspects of this. I love that it only has 13 ingredients, no parabens, silicone, or frangrance. Many skin products cause me to break out in tiny little bumps, and I am allergic to gold. I'm also being tested for other metal allergies (although I tested negative for nickel and cobalt already). I'm not sure how this is supposed to protect from metal irritants, but it certainly can't hurt. I also like that it is made in France.There is no scent (which I prefer since fragrances are highly allergenic). The lotion itself is a bit thin and oily. It certainly isn't a ""dry"" lotion. It rubs in well though and does not leave me feeling greasy or looking shiny. It makes my skin feel soft and doesn't just disappear into my skin like some thinner lotions do. I usually prefer thicker lotions for really dry skin. I think this is a great daily lotion for hydration and protection though.The instructions do say to shake before use. I received a discount on my purchase in exchange for trying the product and leaving an honest review. I'm a very loyal customer to brands that I like, and I don't usually like a lot of different skin products since I do tend to break out and have reactions. So far I really like this though. I just have to keep it away from my husband who would use it up and then balk at the cost of a new bottle. I will update my review if anything happens to change my opinion.update: I have been going through allergy testing to figure out why my forehead is always covered with small red bumps. So far I don't have a positive diagnosis, but I'm leaning toward it being from tocopheryl acetate which is basically vitamin E made in a lab. Vitamin E is very good for the skin so it is used in many skin products. Unfortunately, it gets mixed with acetic acid (the same acid that's in vinegar) in order to make it cheaper and longer lasting. The result is no longer good for skin as it can produce sensitizing and irritation as well as encouraging the carcinogenic effects of UV rays. After recognizing that this ingredient may be my problem, I've been reading through all of the products in my bathroom and was dismayed to find it listed in this lotion. This lotion has very limited ingredients and was specially formulated for those with sensitive skin. I just wish they had stuck with real, pure vitamin E. If you don't have problems with this ingredient then you'll probably love this lotion. If you might already be sensitive to it or have contact dermatitis of unknown origins then just be aware of it in case you have any reactions. Otherwise, I definitely think it's worth a try.update2: After seeking advice from a doctor, dermatologist, and allergist, I finally found a really good dermatologist that seems to know more than the others. She thinks that all of my little bumps are due to the fact that I use facial moisturizer at all. Apparently my oil glands do their job just fine without any additional moisturizing. Certain products (such as sunscreens) that contain moisturizing or oily ingredients can make it worse. On her advice, I have quit using moisturizer on my face. The bumps haven't gone away, but they aren't as noticeable and haven't flared up either.I'm not convinced that this is the problem or at least not the only problem because I get little bumps on the top of my arms after using certain lotions on my arms too, and they're dry. I never used the skintifique lotion on my face, but I have used it on my arms without a reaction.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71F49TBJKLL.jpg,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71cWrZWtiIL.jpg",normal,"normal_B00N2Y7VI0_pid400_0,normal_B00N2Y7VI0_pid400_1",https://www.amazon.com/CeraVe-Moisturizing-Lotion-Hyaluronic-Fragrance/dp/B07RK4HST7/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=B07RK4HST7&qid=1592511881&sr=8-1,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51YT4dO6bfL._SL1000_.jpg

412,412,B00NV9KLXS,NIVEA Nourishing In-Shower Body Lotion - Non-Sticky For Dry to Very Dry Skin - 13.5 fl. oz. Bottle,"1/16/17 UPDATE:  Initially, no issues with using it in the shower, as we wash out our shower after each use anyway. However, after using this for a few months now, it has damaged the floor of our shower.  We have river rock with sea glass for our floor that has been sealed very well with top of the line sealer, and the off white grout has turned a veiny dark brown where I stand to apply the lotion.  We're now on week 2 of daily degreaser scrubbing and it's slowly coming up.  As for how the product feels, I like it, but it's not worth the damage that it's causing to our shower.  Sad to say, I won't buy this again.  I also have a very unhappy husband right now.  Not worth it at all.  Updating from 5 stars to 1, I might give it 5 again if I start showering in the yard, but it'll probably kill our grass.ORIGINAL REVIEW: I think I went through way too much the first time I used it. It's thickness is that of lotion. I think I was expecting more of a soap/lotion combo. Learning curve though, no biggie. A little does go a long way. I loved how this made my skin feel afterwards and the scent is beautiful! I'll be buying this again.Use hot water when rinsing out the shower, cold will leave it slippery. This is no biggie for us as we rinse the shower after every use anyway. No issues there as far as I'm concerned.My skin feels great!

And this is from a woman lol. I want to smell nice, but not overtly like a baked good. Just sayin. This has a pleasing fragrance but goes away fairly quickly and doesn't overpower your shampoo/conditioner/body wash once you get out of the shower. It makes your skin moist without having to put lotion on and then lay on a towel for 10 mins while it dries before ya put clothesOn. Win!

419,419,B0009F3O8Q,Palmer's Cocoa Butter Formula Daily Skin Therapy Body Lotion with Vitamin E | 13.5 Fl Oz,What I liked about this product is (Just my personal views be respectful please)1. I have moderate to severe eczema and even tho this isn't the crazy expensive stuff people with my condition are used to it helps cool the burn when I don't have anything. Doesn't help the itching at all tho.2. The scent is really good as well it's texture is completely different if u have tried the raw form they have . That one smells good but lingers way to long lol. This is just right.3. Probably my favorite thing about the Palmer's brand . The fact that it gets rid of scars and tones skin. I have been using this for 6 months and I have before and after pics of u keep a healthy skin and eat clean stuff worksDislikes:1. As u can see in this picture it takes a while for the lotion to actually rub in sometimes leaving some residue if u don't really rub it super well.

Also, I have no idea if this technique would work on darker skin than mine.Secondly, I have dry and sensitive skin.

The only thing I don’t like is it sometimes peels off when I apply it first under my makeup and I think it’s because of the sunscreen that’s in it. However it does moisturize pretty well and doesn’t burn when applied to dry skin or sensitive under eyes area,5.0 out of 5 stars,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ix7x7NNtL.jpg,normal,normal_B00F97FHAW_pid430_0,https://www.amazon.com/CeraVe-Moisturizing-Lotion-Hyaluronic-Fragrance/dp/B07RK4HST7/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=B07RK4HST7&qid=1592511881&sr=8-1,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51YT4dO6bfL._SL1000_.jpg

Right away I noticed it’s wayyyyyy less oily and has more of matte finish. It controls oil throughout the day and it’s wonderful. If you have dry skin though you may find it’s a little too lightweight. After using the cleaning water, day cream and night cream I’ve noticed drastic improvements in my skin and with this NC summer heat humidity these are the only products touching my face and I have had zero breakouts or issues.Cereve makes incredible products and is worth every penny seriously!

484,484,B0107QOZR0,NIVEA Cocoa Butter In-Shower Body Lotion - Non-Sticky For Dry to Very Dry Skin - 13.5 oz. Bottle,"The Nivea In-Shower Cocoa Butter Body Lotion is mean to be used in the shower and RINSED OFF while in the shower.  It is not meant to be used as a typical body lotion.  Personally, I like the fragrance and the results! Especially with Fall and Winter on the way, this will definitely help!  The only reason for my 4 stars versus 5 is that it does leave the shower somewhat slippery. Just let the water run for an extra minute once you get out and all is fine.

Even though I'm only 26 I still try to take care of myself when it comes to the sun, especially my face.I had been eyeing this stuff for a few months. Back in April I had gone tanning in a tanning bed a handful times at my gym. I had a wedding to go to in the beginning of May and being pale with a red dress & white heels is a no no. Every time I set foot into a tanning bed I always feel guilty because of the dangers of tanning beds. I only go a few times before the summer starts otherwise it isn't a usual habit of mine but the guilt is still there lol. I've always wanted to try a spray tan but I work in a swimming pool year round and I've always been nervous about the color bleeding out into the pool.Anyway, after I had attended the wedding I went to, I had stopped going tanning for about three or three and a half weeks. At this point I wasn't really that tan anymore, especially my skin being dried out from the water. I saw this stuff again at my local Walmart. I've been wanting to try it so I finally took the plunge. I have to say I've only used it twice, but I'm pleasantly surprised how well it works and how good it looks. I've tried a few self tanners in the past. I tried Hempz a few years back and it made me look super orange and streaky after three or four times. I tried another Jergen's lotion and it was so so. This is my holy grail! I live for moisturizers because of my dry skin due to the pool. I don't look orange, the color doesn't run in the pool, it doesn't transfer onto my clothes, it's not streaky or messy to apply, and there's no weird smell. It actually smells pretty decent. I love this stuff and the color not running is huge for me since most days I'm wet in a pool.The last time I had went tanning was three weeks ago which could possibly make this review a little biased, but I really notice a big difference when my tan from going tanning had faded.I'd definitely purchase this stuff again. I haven't tried putting it on my face. I'm not sure if you're supposed to, but for my body it's great so far!

When I turned the shower off, I rubbed the water on my skin like I would lotion so the water would be more evenly distributed. I put on slightly more than the recommended amount until I felt a creamy texture on my skin instead of watery. I started above and below my knees and above and below my elbows before rubbing on those areas. I immediately patted dry with my towel. I rubbed over my feet, knees, elbows, and wrists with my towel. Then I used a little baby powder on those areas especially where tanner tends to over soak. I could tell a difference in color almost immediately and within an hour I was a few shades darker than my natural skin tone. I have zero streaks and patches.

I'm that gross kinda pale where you can see my veins and I'm going to Vegas in a month. I figured I'd see if I could get away with this.So it does give you a subtle glow, but you have to be really careful you dont sweat after application, which is hard to do after a shower (I get shower sweats sometimes). If you do you will get a streak like I have. You have to get an exfloiater brush as well to make sure it doesn't build up around knees, ankles, elbows, ect.It also does still smell. That self tanning smell that's a little like corn chips. It is slightly less than their other lotion, but it is still clearly there.So, IMO, this stuff works just like the other dry skin lotion, except it's a bit more of a hassle. It really depends on what you need out of a tanning lotion.If you want just a bit of color and a little less of a smell, with the added bonus of being an ""in shower"" lotion; this is for you.If you want a self tanner, but are too scared to try the ones with the gloves, just do their normal tanning lotion. It's a lot simpler, even if it smells just a bit stronger. I'll probably end up using that instead of this for Vegas, as I'll have sunscreen on anyway and that will cover the smell.",3.0 out of 5 stars,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61uf540VJNL.jpg,normal,normal_B01NADTX4F_pid553_0,https://www.amazon.com/CeraVe-Moisturizing-Lotion-Hyaluronic-Fragrance/dp/B07RK4HST7/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=B07RK4HST7&qid=1592511881&sr=8-1,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51YT4dO6bfL._SL1000_.jpg

555,555,B07S98BMH9,Cerave SA Cream | 19 oz | Renewing Salicylic Acid Body Cream for Rough & Bumpy Skin | Fragrance Free,"OMG. I had a serious psoriasis outbreak and I was beside myself with pain & itching.  I read that salicylic acid helps psoriasis. I searched on Amazon for different creams and purchased this while on travel.  The cream has a nice texture and it is not too greasy and does not stain. It did not burn or tingle after I applied it. Within 24 hours my psoriasis started to heal up & the itch subsided. I was shocked that all my red spots and plaques completely healed up within 48 hours. I will use this creme 4 for the rest of my life, I highly highly recommend trying this creme if you suffer from psoriasis. The results will astound you. And I have tried many creams including prescription creams that the mayo clinic prescribed for me. Unbelievable as it sounds this cream worked the best for me. Check out my before and after pictures. I just wish I had stock in this company or had an ownership interest because this cream is going to make them a fortune.  Also if you are a psoriasis sufferer no matter what cream you put on you, you must be careful not to scratch. Where ever you scratch you will spread the psoriasis. So wash your  hands  each time you apply cream  to a different area of your body. If you do not you will spread the psoriasis. I know because I’ve had it now for year ( mine was brought on by Exemestane (Aromasin)  and I have studied psoriasis extensively. I am a nurse and I understand the importance of contact and spreading of skin diseases. I hope that my review will help psoriasis sufferers everywhere because until I discovered that salicylic acid can help  psoriasis and then discovered this cream that has the perfect formulation, I was miserable. I was crying in pain and worried that it would spread to my face. And it had started on my face but this  wonderful cream cleared it up.

556,556,B07S98BMH9,Cerave SA Cream | 19 oz | Renewing Salicylic Acid Body Cream for Rough & Bumpy Skin | Fragrance Free,"I have been suffering from KP bumps and ingrown hairs for a really long time ( over a decade now). I have tried so many things to get rid of these bumps. A little background into my personal situation is that I have a milk chocolate skin tone and it is generally very silky smooth. My skins main issue beside the KP is that my skin is very sensitive and prone to dryness ( I have read that KP and ingrown hairs are common in those who have sensitive skin since KP is a overproduction of keritin to protect the skin [is the guess] but it is genetic and usually rarely goes away for most [ contrary to popular belief]). So I have had these bumps for so long and I have tried exfoliates and moisturizers but in vain. My problem areas are the backs of my arms especially around the elbows,the front of my thighs and the most severe place is the bottom half of my legs around the knee area. My main issue was to smooth the bumpy texture of these bumps. I always used shower puffs and Aveeno ( as my general daily moisturizer I still use it) and most recently Goldbond for Rough and Bumpy Skin. The Goldbond moisterizer was a 6/10 because it really aided the bumps on my thighs and the back of my arm but did nothing for my most severe location by my knees. After I waxed again ingrown hairs arrived on my thighs and the Goldbond did nothing so I decided to find a new solution.  I always used Cerave products but the price on this lotion really had me holding back from trying it but I finally did and I am so glad I did. I have been using to for only a month now but within the first few days there was a noticeable change and the bumps are all smoothed out. Unlike other moisturizers like the Goldbond it does not peel off and for a thick lotion it absorbs quickly into the skin. I use it every day, after I shower I just stand for about 5 minutes to make sure it fully absorbs and I thought I would never feel my silky smooth skin on my legs again but I finally did! I paired the Cerave with exfoliation for maximum results  used Earth Therapeutics Hydro Exfoliating glove as well and Gigi no bumps body scrub and both of them left my skin sooooo soft after showering but the Cerave just got rid of the rest of the bumps. I strongly recommend this for anyone suffering from KP and ingrown hairs! Especially if you have a bump issue. I am dark skin so the appearance of KP bumps discoloration is not to noticeable on my skin but I did notice a little fade in discoloration but not a whole lot so far after 2 weeks or so all my bumps smoothed and only time will tell if the discoloration will go away signifcantly. Overall a 10/10! 5 stars! I can't believe it works! I recommend it to anyone but remember to exfoliate as well for best results. Hope this long review helps someone.UPDATE 2/6/2017: ( The picture is from the beginning of 2017. After using the product for a few months after purchasing it in 2015, this was my results and they have been consistant since [throughout the rest of 2015-2016 and now 2017].) After using this product for about almost two years now it has worked very well! I regret not taking before shots because I assumed like all the other products I tried that it would not work or do anything, so there was no point! Ugh! I regret it! This product still works for me and I am happy my skin has not adjusted to it. My routine is the same,an exfoliating glove, dove soap, my GiGi scrub and Aveeno lotion that is fragrance free. I was about once a month because I generally am not harry and I exfoliate before and after my waxes and I use this to moisturize for about a week after my wax. I also use it randomly, especially when cold even if it has been weeks since I waxed. My bumps are still visible, but has lightened only slightly. I have darker skin so they do not show up anyways. Like I said before my texture and the feel of the bumps was my concern and still is. This product has left my skin soooo smooth I feel like I never had KP bumps! My final verdict is that this is perfect for smoothing those bumps, but if you are concern with discoloration this will help but you will need something extra. However, this is still great for those with dry, KP and ingrown hair prone skin. Hope I helped :)",5.0 out of 5 stars,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71I11HpCgXL.jpg,normal,normal_B07S98BMH9_pid556_0,https://www.amazon.com/CeraVe-Moisturizing-Lotion-Hyaluronic-Fragrance/dp/B07RK4HST7/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=B07RK4HST7&qid=1592511881&sr=8-1,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51YT4dO6bfL._SL1000_.jpg

This has been a game changer for me; As before my skin was inflamed (red and the pores left open and exposed to crap in the air) 24/7. And I’ve gone through a lot of other brands to try to treat it! It’s been 1 week since I’ve been using this: twice daily and using with the SA wash! I’m posting the “before and after” photo so the photo can speak for itself! Again, this is only 7 days between photos, so it’s still in progress but I already love it! From my experience, the SA wash and cream causes a *very mild* “burning” sensation or itch but I has to be patient. It wasn’t too bothersome and it became better over time for me. The results are paying off for me so I will continue using! There are no smell that I can pick up on this and it feels clean! The SA cream if you use after the wash is thick but I use it sparingly. Good luck to you guys. My skin was complicated and I hope it works for you guys like it did for me.OK UPDATE- I think it’s about 3 weeks now and as I’m using this (and my skin is continuing to clear up), and as I am starting to put a little dent into the jar... as I rub the cream into my face, I’m noticing sharp little shards of solid pieces!!! It almost looks like fiber glass. Not sure what it is and it does poke into my skin and I am wondering if that’s what I was feeling (mild burning, or even micro cuts... so the product can “exfoliate” that I mentioned on my first review during 1st week of use). Ok I don’t mind exfoliating HOWEVER what if I accidentally get some of the dried shards I to my eyes? That stuff doesn’t dissolve at all or quickly. I’ve been going alto us with my face moistened with shards sparkling on my face too. It’s noticeable when I’m in bright lighting.

I used this twice a day, once in the morning and once before bed, every day for two months. Pros: I instantly felt a difference with the moisture levels on my skin. I have constantly battled overly dry skin (in conjunction with keratosis pilaris) all my life and no other product has worked or lasts as long throughout the day as this. As a whole, the texture of my skin has shown significant and noticable improvement. I also really liked the smell. It isn't made with fragrance but the smell is nice and neutral, yet unique and pleasant. Cons: I was hoping this was going to help with the red dots on my skin. There is a slight difference in the amount/area of skin the dots span but I'm disappointed that the before and after of two months is not nearly as drastic or as noticable as I was hoping. I have also noticed that I have started to get tiny white heads on my arms. No big deal, but still not something I'm thrilled about. The two first pictures are before, the last two pictures are after I have been using this for two months. Would I buy this product again? Probably but only until I can find something else that takes care of the red dots. If you're looking for a moisturizer that WORKS buy this.

I had no idea I could make my skin as smooth as it is now.  My arms and legs are silky even if I don't shave.  Those tiny bumps are gone and my skin affected by psoriasis is getting better.

Yeah. I know. I should’ve used sunscreen, but I didn’t. So I decided to give this a shot because the Internet said they highly recommend it. BOOOOOOOY, I’m shook. It didn’t happen over night, but after 3 months of consistently exfoliating every night and using this lotion twice a day, you can honestly see a significant difference. Peep the pictures. Especially with the texture of my skin. Now visually, it’s still there, but not as bad as before. I really recommend giving this a try. It works. Slowly, but surely. If you’re curious about the product it is a bit thick applying it on and a little sticky afterwards, but it eventually soaks into your skin and you can kind of feel it throughout the day on your skin, but don’t let that discourage your purchase.

589,589,B00SNPCSUY,CeraVe Night Cream for Face | 1.7 Ounce | Skin Renewing Night Cream with Hyaluronic Acid & Niacinamide | Packaging May Vary,"I have been using this miracle pot since last year.Let's start off with the moisturizing quality of CeRave  Night Cream; the pictures I uploaded show me facing the front of my living room window with natural lighting. There is a little bit of ""shine"" on the sides of my forehead (where I tend to apply some highlighting makeup anyway), but to wake up to this kind of glow on my face first thing in the morning? You BET I took a selfie and sent it to any friend who cared! When I smiled, there is no resistance on my face, meaning my skin is WELL-moisturized! I mention this because for some of my other regular face cream (even when it isn't for night time) the moisture would be gone by morning. And that's another thing I wanted to mention to you all: THIS CREAM goes a long way even with a very small amount that you apply on your fingers-- all the better, too, because the formula works to keep your face moisturized and healing all through the night. And what I mean by ""healing"" is restoring the balance of the moisture on your face to a supple condition. Because CeRave night cream has Hyaluronic acid which gives it that precise effect since hyaluronic acid pulls in moisture from your environment.For sensitive skin, I have no true review for it because my skin is not sensitive. I have oily skin but tend to suffer from overdrying. For me this occurs because I like to wash my face in the morning as well as in the night time (which is regular for many people, especially those that wear makeup). For my skin type, I've found that CeRave works very well with it. I really appreciate their AM moisturizer with the SPF because it has no oil in it, so it goes on without the ""greasy"" feel.The reason why I'm giving this product  A 5-STAR rating for its scent is because THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO SCENT! WHAT? YES, PLEASE! It is not always okay to rely on a moisturizer that is scented because it takes other formulas to be added into it, which may then irritate the skin. CeRave did a great job leaving this unscented, I love it. The only things I could wish for when it comes to this product is a bigger size, maybe, since this pot DOES feel a little small when holding it in your hand. But for the amount of benefits your skin will get from this, and like I said, a little goes a long way-- it can actually last a long time. For me it lasts a good 3-4 months.And you know what? If you use it regularly (if you have skin like mine), you'll start to notice that your skin is ""happy"". You'll notice by the way it is supple and has a subtle glow.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/6136VNhwhEL.jpg,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71egHWdEk+L.jpg",normal,"normal_B00SNPCSUY_pid589_0,normal_B00SNPCSUY_pid589_1",https://www.amazon.com/CeraVe-Moisturizing-Lotion-Hyaluronic-Fragrance/dp/B07RK4HST7/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=B07RK4HST7&qid=1592511881&sr=8-1,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51YT4dO6bfL._SL1000_.jpg

I do have skin issues and therefore am prone to rashes or breakouts. I have typically used only herbal face washes over the last few years due to my mix texture and sensitive skin. However since CeraVe is so highly regarded by dermatologist I wanted to try it out because of an oily T-zone but dry around my cheeks and mouth area. So far the foam face wash is very good because it has a light feel and a gentle wash is all I need. There is no scent, however I do feel the the foam is doing a very good job of cleaning it without drying it out. Its only been a week since I started using it, but so far I've not had any rashes or breakouts. 👍",4.0 out of 5 stars,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31hr1TgprqL.jpg,normal,normal_B07RJ18VMF_pid627_0,https://www.amazon.com/CeraVe-Moisturizing-Lotion-Hyaluronic-Fragrance/dp/B07RK4HST7/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=B07RK4HST7&qid=1592511881&sr=8-1,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51YT4dO6bfL._SL1000_.jpg

633,633,B00365DABC,"CeraVe Facial Moisturizing Lotion PM | 3 Ounce | Ultra Lightweight, Night Face Moisturizer | Packaging May Vary","This is the holy grail. This is THE STUFF. I'm in my late 20's and I was diagnosed with ""pre-rosacea"" - a mild redness to my cheeks and jawline, but none of the other symptoms such as acne. My skin looked and felt chronically dry to the point of itching no matter what I used. My skin was like, perpetually chapped. I tried everything: dandruff shampoo (for the selenium), zinc/sulphur soap (anti-bacterial), sea buckthorn oil, primrose oil, hemp oil, maracuja oil (anti-inflammatory), and azelaic acid (finacea). Nothing worked and if anything they all just exacerbated the problem.Enter niacinamide aka B3 aka the miracle ingredient that not only has anti-aging properties but, as it turns out, the ability to ""address skin discolorations"". Yeeeeah, you can side-eye that description if you want, I too am tired of reading about how blahblah ingredient calms redness or is an anti-inflammatory (anti-inflammatory for me=run for the hills because you're about to get a big old dose of RED)  But no, niacinamide has bigger plans than that. It is a 'cell communicating' ingredient that basically tells your well-meaning but crappier skin cells ""hey, wake up and behave like you care a little"". You know how when you first wake up your skin is clear and beautiful and ohmygod I-am-having-the-best-skin day ever, til you actually stand up and start moving around and then BAM it's like you ran hot water on your face except it never goes away? This product actually somehow maintains that morning skin for me, all the time. Additionally the texture has improved and it finally feels hydrated. So yeah, I recommend this product.I plan on adding vit C to my routine soon (for anti-aging) which could go either way with my skin. I have high hopes.

I have noted ingredients changed (without warning) see attached picture. I havent yet evaluated what these ingredients are and whether the changes were positive (health/safety/benefits) or negative (i.e. cost savings) and I dont know which new ingredient might be the culprit for the smell or whether its not an ingredient issue but production issue.

I found this thanks to Paula Begoun, cosmetic / skincare guru (CHECK HER OUT!) when I needed a moisturizer for my acne-prone yet dry, sensitive skin.  I also needed something I could purchase locally without spending an arm and a leg (I am NOT the dept. store / whole entire skincare line/ fancy product type).  It's not as cheap as some options but I'll tell you what, it's money VERY well spent.  This, along with clean and clear's foaming wash for sens. skin and a washcloth (don't underestimate it's power) comprises my entire skincare routine and I couldn't be happier.  I have hardly had a blemish since and I don't suffer from dryness like I used to.  Need I say more?I use it once a day, when I wash my face at night (either in the shower or at the sink) and it goes on super smooth and absorbs well.  Sometimes, esp. when the weather's really dry, I use it in the morning too (so go ahead and disregard that PM in the title - I think it's just because it doesn't have a sunscreen component).  I also appreciate that it works so well that my skin no longer feels 'tight' and painful after a shower pre-moisturizer - that to me is a sign it's working at a deeper level.  No stinging, no residue, just healthy skin.  Plus, while the best price is usually thru Subscribe and Save I like that if I'm ever in a pickle (ie -out of town) I can find it at a local drugstore and remain on a regimen that works so well for me.",5.0 out of 5 stars,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/714NURiIyFL.jpg,normal,normal_B00365DABC_pid652_0,https://www.amazon.com/CeraVe-Moisturizing-Lotion-Hyaluronic-Fragrance/dp/B07RK4HST7/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=B07RK4HST7&qid=1592511881&sr=8-1,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51YT4dO6bfL._SL1000_.jpg

If anything, it was a bit more of a slight earthy (like a really light cocoa) smell but it went away almost immediately after application. I loved that once it was applied, it literally didn’t smell like anything. I was able to spray my favorite perfume after without having to worry about the smells not mixing well together.Back to the application, a little bit went a really long way and spread across my skin with absolute ease. I work in the healthcare industry and am constantly washing my hands (they are in constant need of moisture). It left my skin feeling quenched and super soft to the touch without that greasy feeling I have gotten from other balms. This also seamed to have placed a moisture barrier as even after washing my hands after application, my hands still felt very hydrated. I appreciate that they included additional information in its packaging showing what other products they have to offer as this is the first time I have ever heard of and used anything from this brand.

Aside of the good size for traveling, the scent is so refreshing. In my opinion it's more of a grapefruit than it is raspberry but it's so delicious. If you enjoy the scent sweet pea from Bath and Body Works, you'll definitely like this scent. Now to review the actual product, it is extremely moisturizing and I am a die hard lotion fanatic. I am using lotion after every single time I was my hands. My hands naturally get pretty dry especially after I do my hair every morning and expose my skin to different hair products. Even using a dime size amount was enough to fully moisturize my hands. This lotion itself is very soothing for my skin and this little bottle will definitely last me considering what little amount you need. I always saw the bigger bottles at Ulta and never purchased them because of the price and I was never able to try this brand until now.

I was offered Hempz 17oz bottle of ""Sweet Raspberry Punch & Champagne Limited Edition"" and thought I might give it a try.Nice bottle, easy open, easy pump no issues there (type 1 plastic recycle if you care about that AND made in the USA, also of note). First thing you're going to notice is the scent. If you like your lotion to definitely have  a fragrance this will please you (as long as you pick a fragrance you like). I tend to be more sensitive to floral scents and I suppose this being berry and whatever champagne is supposed to smell like it didn't bother my sensitivity but it will smack you in the nose with scent. I would not recommend wearing this with other fragrances. I count this particular feature as a good thing because I'd think someone buying lotion partly for the scent wants to smell it. This particular fragrance is heavy on the fruity smell and more of a candied raspberry as opposed to anything sharp.In applying it to the skin it is light, not greasy feeling but does feel like there is a moisture ""barrier"" as they might call it after it is all rubbed in (doesn't hold up too well to hand washing but it's not a hand cream so I give that a pass). Since it is classified as a body moisturizer per the bottle I wouldn't expect it to be heavy and it rubs in fairly quickly. I would not call this a heavy duty lotion and if you need something that's going to be for dry skin I might not start here myself, but I think it would be perfect for anyone with normal skin and you will also smell nice.The height of the fragrance lasts quite a while (for me it was at least an hour), and even after it fades if you were put your arm up to your nose or even walk past someone who hasn't smelled it yet, it will still be noticed. I haven't come across a lotion in my lifetime that will have a scent that will last all day and frankly that's ok with me as long as the fragrance doesn't go stale, and this one didn't. My only warning for you would be if you work in an environment that discourages heavy scents this is NOT the lotion to buy. I think it's a good product, and will be best for people who want a well fragranced, non greasy, not heavy body lotion.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61nZ8dSqBTL.jpg,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61xqQb7YSaL.jpg",normal,"normal_B00U97TO6U_pid712_0,normal_B00U97TO6U_pid712_1",https://www.amazon.com/CeraVe-Moisturizing-Lotion-Hyaluronic-Fragrance/dp/B07RK4HST7/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=B07RK4HST7&qid=1592511881&sr=8-1,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51YT4dO6bfL._SL1000_.jpg

735,735,B003RF82UK,"Garnier SkinActive Moisture Rescue Face Moisturizer, Normal/Combo,  1.7 oz.","It's been about a year and a half since I buckled down on skin care. I'm a 41 female, and grew up in the time when washing your face with noxema or using ponds to clean your face instead of bar soap was considered, ""skin care,"" at the time. Shortly followed by olay for sunscreen and moisturizer.No dig on those who use olay still. But the regiment was a bit lacking.Last year I jumped at a change at another brand's skin care set that was on sale. The cleanser and exfoliate was great. The night time moisturizer cream was great. The day time moisturizer...aeeeeeaaa. Well, it left my face sticky AND greasy and was too heavy for me. I ended up becoming a cat-hair magnet anytime I used it after washing my face. Yuck!I was looking to try something new, since I stopped using the daily and started using the ""nightly,"" both morning and night after cleansing. Saw this had a lot of decent reviews, and I finally had some extra cash. It also says it's for normal to combo skin and I do have combo (oily nose and brow, dry cheeks.)This moisturizer arrived in perfect condition. The safety seal on the outside as well as the inside was unbroken and whole.PROS:- Being a prime member meant that I ordered it 3 days ago and it arrived yesterday.- It IS very light and yet SUPER moisturizing without being greasy. I washed my face and tried this last night after getting it and my skin absorbed it quick, my face felt moisturized, not dry, my T zone didn't feel remotely oily or greasy. Bonus points: not a single cat hair stuck to my face.- Very, very very light and cooling/refreshing. It looks and reminds me of aloe vera lotion. Using it on my face gave it a cooler sensation but without that tingly/harshness of anything other natural evaporation (like, you know how some stuff has mint or tea tree oil and it gives that tingly cooling sensation? Not this!)- A little goes a long way! I took my index finger and lightly touched the gel. I dabbed my finger on forehead, nose, both cheeks, chin and neck then rubbed it in and it was the perfect amount to cover ALL those areas. With my night-time cream I had been using, I would have to dip both fingers before dotting, and sometimes go back a third time because of drier cheeks.- Light, very light scent. The scent is refreshing and very 'natural'/'nature' smelling. If strong scents trigger migraines or nausea or strong scents cause issues for you, this may not do so. However, I am NOT allergic or triggered by perfumes and added scents, so take that bit of advice with caution for you very sensitive skin/scent people out there.- Price!! It is actually a few bucks cheaper than my other basement bargain beauty brand (e.l.f.) and as someone who's in debt up to her eyeballs and previously retail part-time employed and recovering, finding a beauty product that is affordable without making my face explode is VERY important. This cream fits those needs perfectly.CONS:- The only con I have is howwww smallllll this container is. If it weren't for the fact that I have used it twice so far and I KNOW that only a tiny bit goes a long way, I would have been a bit disappointed by how small it is.That's the only down side to this moisture cream so far to me, the size.I am only the second day in using it, so if during the week things change and my skin reacts unexpectedly, I will definitely come back to edit and update. So far?

740,740,B00BN2UF54,CeraVe Therapeutic Hand Cream for Dry Cracked Hands | 3 Ounce | With Hyaluronic Acid and Niacinamide | Packaging May Vary,"I purchased this after reading reviews about its quick absorption. I struggle to keep my hands moisturized because I write and draw a lot and the greasy feeling of most hand creams makes it difficult to hold a pen and other things after application. I have used other Cerave products and I know they are a reputable skin care brand, so I had high expectations. I can confidently say that this product is wonderful. The consistency was unexpected—less of a cream, more of a gel/lotion that spreads easily. It does have the typical greasy feeling immediately after applying, but within 5 minutes the feeling I get from other hand creams was completely gone and my hands were super soft. It is also unscented which is great for me in terms of using at work in an office space.

Also, same as another product I bought and have reviewed, a toddler could open it, which is scary because they'll try anything, sometimes large amounts--and this is not food, although it smells very appealing, and that's the problem. Companies are saving themselves work and money by sending items out unprotected.Ignore the part missing, it arrived looking smooth and new inside. I scooped out some to try before giving a review, no other way to do that--as opposed to The Petal Fresh ""Body Butter"" that I found that way, with a huge hole, missing product--air hole or someone sampled it? I don't know.As for this, if you don't mind the grittiness, use it as I did--on feet or elbows. It is far too gritty and thick for someone's face or other parts of the body you don't want mucked up, plus the clogged pores.I put on double socks after using this with the other product.So if the company sent this product safety-sealed, I could recommend it for the two spots mentioned--feet and elbows; otherwise, go elsewhere.

836,836,B01FA87072,"Jergens Wet Skin Body Moisturizer with Restoring Argan Oil, 10 Fl Oz (Pack of 4) (Packaging May Vary)","Previous to trying this product I have used a similar product from Eucerin, a skin lotion that you are supposed to apply when you are still wet after a shower, before toweling off.  The Eucerin product sounded like a good idea but in reality it wasn’t. It stayed on the skin and came off on the towel, leaving it greasy and unfit to use again until it was washed, and I don’t wash my towels after every shower.Jergens Wet Skin lotion did better.  But not at first. It seems you can’t get away from the fact that oil and water don’t mix.  When I first applied it the cream turned sticky and gooey. Not a good initial feeling.  But by the time I stepped out of the shower and started toweling off I noticed that the towel wasn’t getting greasy … an improvement over the competitive lotion. By the time I was dry there was no trace of the product on my skin other than the coconut scent.  I mean NO trace. My skin felt exactly the same as it always does, which at this time of year is dry.I see no advantage to using this over using ordinary Jergens lotion as needed throughout the day. Fortunately, if the selling price continues to be about $3 per 6 ounce tube, you are paying about the same for this as regular Jergens lotion, so it becomes entirely a personal choice which to use but it offers no overwhelming advantage over regular lotion.GOOD TO KNOWOver and above the review of how it works, here’s some optional information you may find useful.1. Few consumer products contain more marketing hype than cosmetics and this is certainly no exception.  It promises to “lock in hydration at skin’s peak moisture moment”. Translation? That would mean it seals in your shower water so it can’t be toweled off. A dubious claim.2. It promises to give you “luminous skin”.  That word, luminous, I do not think it means what they think it means. According to the dictionary, luminous means “full of or shedding light; bright or shining, especially in the dark”.  I can assure you that my skin is not shining and I do not glow in the dark as a result of using this product.3. Jergens instructs you to dry yourself by patting yourself dry with the towel. Who does that?4. While they don’t include any specific use directions or warnings they allude to this product being only intended for use on the arms and legs.  From experience I can tell you to keep this away from your private areas and common sense would say to keep it away from your eyes.",4.0 out of 5 stars,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51BZ8iIYIVL.jpg,normal,normal_B01FA87072_pid836_0,https://www.amazon.com/CeraVe-Moisturizing-Lotion-Hyaluronic-Fragrance/dp/B07RK4HST7/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=B07RK4HST7&qid=1592511881&sr=8-1,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51YT4dO6bfL._SL1000_.jpg

One of the things I've had to accept about these lines is that it took a long time to get them, so it will take a long time to see a really big improvement. What I like about this cream first and foremost is the smell. So many other firming creams, especially the big brand-name ones, don't smell that great, and because of this I could only use it at night. The smell on this one is light and pleasant. While I've only been using this one for a month, I have seen an improvement. I know that if I continue to use it, I will see an even better improvement.

It is SO hard to get this kind of product with all the ""bad"" stuff removed.  GET THIS:  NO DYE  .. OILS ... FRAGRANCE ... SILICONES ... PARABENS.  And it's wonderfully NON-COMEDOGENIC, so no clogged pores!  This basically is my  ""don't"" wish list for all skin creams. For me, it's totally worth its  weight in gold, and its claims are true as I've found all their products to be.In California, I especially need sunscreen year-round and it's so hard to find a face product that works as a moisturizer with sunscreen, but still provides a nice canvas for foundation.  Usually, they don't blend well together.  In this case, the moisturizer is perfect for me and contains 15 SPF -- yes, that's the minimal SPF, but still workable.  Actually, I'm layering it over another OLAY sunscreen with higher SPF, and then my foundation.  Works like a charm and makes me feel ""protected"" at the same time.  The pump bottle has a twist lock, and the product is creamy white with great spreadability and coverage.  Not a matte finish or greasy on the skin. The more important factor for me was that nothing about it irritates my skin in any way, and yet still has decent SPF protection.  All the ingredients left out of this moisturizer shouldn't be used by anyone anyway, so the product really has universal appeal.  You need not have sensitive skin to benefit from using it.  Oddly enough, this was my second OLAY product this week that I've never used before, which is weird because I'm a long-time, loyal OLAY consumer and should know about it.

You can see the DRASTIC IMPROVEMENTS in just 3 weeks! Especially considering how damaged my skin was, this product is absolutely AMAZING and WORKS FAST! My face had a bad breakout, especially on my forehead. I got this product to remove the dark spots and in just ONE week I already began to see results. By the second week it was even better! I've included a picture at the third week, and you can see just how much better my skin has become already! I used the product twice a day, everyday, for 3 weeks and the results are just INCREDIBLE. (I also included a picture sometime after the 3 week mark, but these results are not consistent with the time frame as I began to forget to use the product regularly; and thus are not reflective of the quality of this product, because it is my own fault I was not using it as often.) I am so happy, I've been recommending it to everyone! Some things to note are that you may experience mild irritation as the serum dries on your skin, you only need to apply a thin layer to the affected areas (nothing unbearable, and still worth it). Also, as the skin begins the peeling process it may actually appear darker before it comes off, but it will reveal much lighter skin if you're patient. Since your skin is peeling, you will need to moisturize and protect your skin from the sun, thankfully I was using this product over a very cloudy season on the year. The packaging has other important information you need to be mindful of, but I HIGHLY RECOMMEND. And the company is very nice, very sweet, personal customer service. I have no complaints! I could not be more thankful this product literally SAVED MY SKIN, it's a MIRACLE WORKER! I've tried so many things and nothing worked so amazing and in such a short time.

I struggled with trying to clear my skin and rid my neck from these hideous scars. I tried everything in the passed and nothing helped. Nothing would remove these dark scars from my skin. I tried other beauty products that removed dark spots on my face such as ""Specific Beauty"" and ""Proactive""........which worked great on my face, however did nothing for removing the area needed most which was my neck. I spoke with a dermatologist who suggested laser surgery to remove the scared tissue......that cost thousands of $$$ that I just did not have. I heard about Hydroquione from a customer who posted her success story on youtube. I was skeptical, but willing to try it out, plus it was only $23.00 and I had a $3.00 coupon from Amazon. I posted the picture of ""Day 1"", as you can see I have a very light skin tone and the very dark drown spots were such an eyesore. I washed my face with ""Biore facial baking soda powder (water activating) cleanser"", which deep cleanse and exfoliates your skin. Then towel pat dry, and applied the ""hydroquinone"" using a rubber glove. Once the serum dried completely on my face (about 35 to 40 minutes) I used ""Rosehip seed oil organic cold press"" as a daily moisturizer. I faithfully committed to this routine twice a day. As you can see in my pictures from day 1 to day 14 THIS PRODUCT REALLY WORKED! My dark spots are fading after just two weeks. Pretty soon they will be gone for life. This product burns when absorbing into the skin, but it doesn't last long. For sunscreen I used ""neutrogena facial suncreen"". I will post my upcoming results in the next 2 weeks which will make a total of 4 weeks of using this product by that time.......stay tuned for my future results.#FeelingLikeA_BrandNewMe",5.0 out of 5 stars,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61Zu++JoVaL.jpg,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Pdxtv-tPL.jpg,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71VF+Dp6oCL.jpg",normal,"normal_B01MXLF8TY_pid983_0,normal_B01MXLF8TY_pid983_1,normal_B01MXLF8TY_pid983_2",https://www.amazon.com/CeraVe-Moisturizing-Lotion-Hyaluronic-Fragrance/dp/B07RK4HST7/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=B07RK4HST7&qid=1592511881&sr=8-1,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51YT4dO6bfL._SL1000_.jpg

I hastily gave 4 stars thinking I was on my way to great skin. Some parts of my skin were unaffected and I thought the instructions indicating darkening were normal. However, since I first tried this in December, I thought I’d peel and be done with this stuff. I’ve been left with a severe burn although I discontinued using the product in December after one week. I’ve been desperately trying to get rid of this damage since then with no luck. I’m forced to wear double the makeup and it can still be seen underneath. Now the summer is coming and the moment I encounter heat, my burn will be exposed. I’ve tried gentle healing techniques such as cocoa butter to help to heal it, but I think this is permanent 3 months later. My skin was a good shape before, I just wanted to even it out, now I hate to be in the house, much less outdoors. In the photo, I applied manuka honey to the scar.Whooo. I have a lot of mixed feelings about this product. Do this on the weekend and never before special occasions!!  I think it’s good for certain skin types, but be warned, there’s a possibility you’ll suffer from irritation, dryness or burns! I have skin made of titanium and it’s been through procedures such as laser hair removal, so I’m accustomed to some kind of skin trauma. With that said, I wanted to even up my side burns, chin, neck and one seriously annoying dark spot on my forehead. The skin surrounding the forehead spot is lightening around the spot, but the spot only got darker. I’m guessing this will take longer to work and needs to be applied with more precision. As for the rest of my face and neck, I noticed the peeling and was amazed that this was a thin layer of skin coming off!!! The shadow on my sides and neck are slowly peeling away. There is some irritation but I’m a champ and added some aloe Vera gel to combat the tight, dry skin. I highly recommend concentrating this product only wear needed and going light until one can determine their pain or irritation threshold.",1.0 out of 5 stars,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71eh7HXdfLL.jpg,normal,normal_B01MXLF8TY_pid986_0,https://www.amazon.com/CeraVe-Moisturizing-Lotion-Hyaluronic-Fragrance/dp/B07RK4HST7/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=B07RK4HST7&qid=1592511881&sr=8-1,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51YT4dO6bfL._SL1000_.jpg

I always applied with a qtip every morning and every night. Score bed. Days 2, 3, 4 looked like madness and yes it burned like someone had a lighter to my face. I literally sat there with a fan but was determined as I saw the wonderful results everyone else had. I stopped use after my morning application on day 5 because my skin was just so raw and I figured I would let it peel, heal, and reveal. The new fresh skin is sooooooo much lighter. I am a freak and still see a few spots that I could continue but I will go to once a day usage now.The final picture is day 7 and it still has another day or two of healing and last bits of skin to flake off but my gosh I am so impressed.

I could tell immediately that it smelled different, which wasn't a good sign. Hoping it would work the same regardless,  I used it for a couple of weeks. Although I didn't see horrible breakouts on my sensitive, combination skin, there was definitely an increase in blemishes, and my oil level was less controlled than it had been for years of using the old stuff. I didn't keep the boxes, but a quick search enabled me to show the differences between the ingredients. I hope Alpha will bring back the old foaming facewash product, which reliably cleansed and controlled oil without drying out or irritating. This is too gentle and aimed at all skin types, whereas the other was recommended for oily skin; this isn't a proper replacement.",2.0 out of 5 stars,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71LaeoRfGhL.jpg,normal,normal_B01D2M4G0C_pid997_0,https://www.amazon.com/CeraVe-Moisturizing-Lotion-Hyaluronic-Fragrance/dp/B07RK4HST7/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=B07RK4HST7&qid=1592511881&sr=8-1,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51YT4dO6bfL._SL1000_.jpg

My mother used it for wrinkles. .I didn't realize the company changed the name. I've been searching for it for years. I used to buy it at Rite Aid here in Pittsburgh.  It's a Wonderful product! Makes my skin look flawless again! But this time I use it for fine lines . Takes about a week to see results..I use it all over my body too.. I can't help myself. I'm addicted.. my skin is radiant soft and young looking. My only complaint is the increase in price. This pic is my skin with no make-up. How old do I look ?

999,999,B01D2M4G0C,Alpha Skin Care Essential Renewal Lotion | Anti-Aging Formula | 10% Glycolic Alpha Hydroxy Acid (AHA) | Reduces the Appearance of Lines & Wrinkles | For Normal to Dry Skin | 4 Oz,"Okay, I've only had this cream one week but I wanted to give the progress so far.  I took some pictures this week to show my skin. I'm going to update it in about 3 weeks - that way it will be a better review but here's what I like so far.1. The way it makes my skin feel - SO soft - I tried another alpha hydroxy cream for more money and less product and it made my face feel tight and like I had a mask on.2. It tingles and has dried out some of my skin around my chin- but that's because it's working - you cannot expect better skin without it first exfoliating - I also have been using their liquid soap for a week so that might also be an affect.3. My complexion looks brighter and lighter - I am NOT a fan of tanned skin - especially when my natural skin color is pale - despite my ignorant attempts as a teenager in Long Island, NY to bake myself - my skin is still pretty decent - about 15 years ago, I was diagnosed with Vitiligo - basically your skin's melanin thinks it's its own enemy and starts to attack itself.  Resulting in patches of white skin througout your body.  Luckily, this only happened on some parts of my body and NOT my face. But? My face darkened permanently - it looked like I was wearing tanner all year long. I HATED it. I really struggled with this because I once had a ""peaches and cream"" complexion - seriously, I was told this and took pride in it.  So for years, I tried some skin products that claimed to lighten my skin but then I read that they were bad for me internally. So, I stopped, I read skin peels or lasering helped but I felt too poor and too scared to try. I started to read that Vitiligo was related to a compromised immune system and the best way to combat it was through diet, exercise, stress management etc. Okay so long story short - I'm now nearing 50 and except for some slightly darker areas on my face (mostly on the sides of my face hear my eyes and barely noticeable) my complexion is looking really nice again. Healthier eating, exercise, meditating, vitamins etc. have helped. This product though? DEFINITELY is making my skin look smoother and creamier - I am super excited to see how much better it looks in 3 more weeks.4. The price is awesome - yes, a few reviews state it's overpriced now and or less product for your money but come on...have you seen the prices of AHA's out there? And the quantities? And more importantly do they work?5. Ialso  just ordered their body cream and eye cream - so now I have 4 of their skin care line!  If you notice in my pictures - my eyes when I smile have some lines that I would like to soften and hopefully the eye cream will help with that.  I'll review that as well in a few weeks.Anyway, I've found the AHA product that works for me - this is it. Thank you so much Alpha Skin Care line.P.S. now if only there was a way to prevent sagging...that's my biggest aging factor - I've tried some videos online to combat it but haven't stuck with them - please contact me here if you have any suggestions.

The kit consist of the refreshing face wash, essential renewal lotion and essential facial moisturizer.The refreshing face wash was really gentle on my skin.

I followed all the directions (put sunscreen on for a week afterwards) and have had no issues so far.The essential facial moisturizer is my FAVORITE. It makes my skin so soft. I put it on at night and when I wake up in the morning, my face feels so soft but not greasy. I hate face lotions that make me feel like I dunked my face in grease.

There was rising heat and irritation and I became worried. At first he said he did not see anything, and then in a matter of seconds he saw that my face was getting red. I then went right into the bathroom and rinsed off my face. We then saw that my face became red and it burned for about 45 minutes, then it stopped.

Instead of the drying effects of an astringent this lotion contains 10% Glycolic Alpha Hydroxy Acid (AHA) which aids in evening skin tone, fighting acne, removing any remaining oils or dirt leaving the skin soft and feeling ultra clean.The Essential Facial Moisturizer, the smallest bottle with a blue label, is an excellent facial moisturizer that is light and won’t clog pores. By utilizing Hyaluronic Acid, Vitamins B, E and Aloe Vera this lotion protects the skin and heals blemishes by hydrating the skin and providing the vital nutrients it needs.This kit ended up working so much better than I’d anticipated.

I have just crested the high side of mid-40s and really wanted to find a good daily sun protectant to guard against [further] aging. This was so well-reviewed, I chose it over the next closest contenders, Roche-Posay products (which I usually love).Unfortunately, the first week of using it, I began to get tiny bumps on my face (not visible to the naked eye, but easily perceived with fingertips when washing or applying moisturizer). I had also been using a new 'flavor' of body lotion, so I went back to my basic tried-and-true products to let everything calm down for a bit, and try to definitively eliminate the culprit.After two weeks, I again applied this on two successive days when I'd be out in the sun for an extended period. On Day 1, once I'd gotten outside and had started perspiring, my neck began burning, then itching maddeningly -- I was only outside in my yard gardening, so ran inside and I washed it thoroughly off my neck.  My face seemed okay, so I left it there, and applied the product again to my ears and face (no neck) on Day 2 when heading out for a long weekend walk.This time, again once I'd gotten outside and started perspiring, the product started burning and itching around my eyebrows and general eye area.  I washed it off as best I could at the next public water fountain.The next day, I began to show itchy, painful swollen patches on my face, ears, and throat (the latter pictured as best I could, but it was difficult to shoot an area I couldn't see!)  This time, there had been no other 'new to me' product used, nor was there anything else that I carefully applied to ears/face/throat, all areas that then became rashy....So alas, not a product I can use, and alas for the waste of a significant amount of money. >:/  I've used other physical sunscreens in the past (eg Badger) without any issues, so it must be some substance in the cream besides that causing the problem.",1.0 out of 5 stars,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71LDvZmtP7L.jpg,normal,normal_B002MSN3QQ_pid1015_0,https://www.amazon.com/CeraVe-Moisturizing-Lotion-Hyaluronic-Fragrance/dp/B07RK4HST7/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=B07RK4HST7&qid=1592511881&sr=8-1,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51YT4dO6bfL._SL1000_.jpg

Product is either used or damaged during shipment, although I believe it can't be the latter since the cap is undamaged. I would return it if i didnt need this sunscreen today.Product:Now let's talk about the fun part: Elta MD's clear sunscreen with niacinamide!

Unless of course your face doesn't like it (patch test just in case).Acne marks/hyperpigmentation on your skin grow darker in the sun.

1030,1030,B07K3261ZD,CeraVe Hyaluronic Acid Face Serum | 1 oz | Hydrating Serum for Face with Vitamin B5 | For Normal to Dry Skin | Paraben & Fragrance Free,"The Good: This ""serum"" really feels more lotion-like and could potentially be used on its own, unlike most hyluronic acid serums that are really about hydrating the skin, but need something to seal in that hydration besides it. It feels smooth on the skin and if you want to pare down the amount of products, this could potentially work.  When I realized all the ingredients in this (more down below), I switched to using this only in the morning, and right before my moisturizer and SPF, and haven't had a problem.The Bad: However, I typically like to use a separate moisturizer instead of a product like this. Dimethicone is the fourth ingredient, so there's a good amount of it in here, and as a result, if you add any other active products to your skin after this serum, it will be harder/take longer for those to penetrate the barrier you've just applied to your skin. In addition, the fifth ingredient is Alcohol Denat, aka denatured alcohol, which can damage your own skin's barrier. It's designed to allow the other ingredients in the formula to penetrate deeper. In general, I try to avoid skincare products with denatured alcohol in them. But your mileage may vary.The Bottom Line: I'm a big fan of Cerave products (their cleansers and most of their moisturizers are holy grail status for me), but this would be at the bottom of my list. I just don't think I'd get another one, so this would be a pass for me.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71hThxMSxmL.jpg,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/815fUjlxRsL.jpg",normal,"normal_B07K3261ZD_pid1030_0,normal_B07K3261ZD_pid1030_1",https://www.amazon.com/CeraVe-Moisturizing-Lotion-Hyaluronic-Fragrance/dp/B07RK4HST7/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=B07RK4HST7&qid=1592511881&sr=8-1,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51YT4dO6bfL._SL1000_.jpg

(I know. I’m sorry. It’s gross) They’re stubborn little bumps, not pimples, that do not go away. I’ve tried exfoliating, acne washes, moisturizers, etc... NOTHING worked. It’s so embarrassing, especially if someone touches my arms.Last night, I used the CeraVe body wash for rough and bumpy skin for the first time. It didn’t feel any different than my usual body washes while I was scrubbing so I really wasn’t expecting to see results - especially after one use. After showering, my skin felt soft but I could still feel the bumps. But, Oh. My. Gosh... when I checked this morning, the backs of my arms are so much smoother. It hasn’t completely taken the bumps away yet but there is a huuugely noticeable difference. I can only imagine how much of a difference I’ll see in a week or two.Quick note - also, it has no smell so I was able to use my usual body wash on the rest of my body without the two smells combatting.",5.0 out of 5 stars,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/613sjUgCr-L.jpg,normal,normal_B077TWXCQV_pid1057_0,https://www.amazon.com/CeraVe-Moisturizing-Lotion-Hyaluronic-Fragrance/dp/B07RK4HST7/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=B07RK4HST7&qid=1592511881&sr=8-1,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51YT4dO6bfL._SL1000_.jpg
1058,1058,B077TWXCQV,CeraVe Body Wash with Salicylic Acid | 10 Ounce | Fragrance Free Body Wash to Exfoliate Rough and Bumpy Skin,"Cerave is my favorite drugstore brand for skincare. I have recently developed bumpy skin along back of my upper arms, back and chest area. It's gotten worse to where it's making me self-conscious, the number of little bumps covering those areas. Cerave is my go to drugstore brand for skincare so I decided to try this. I wasn't too impressed with the size bottle for the price but i got this for 50% off with subscribe and save to try it. If it worked then I'd gladly pay the $10 regular price in the future. It comes in a plastic bottle (as shown) with flip top cap dispenser on top. Product comes out as a clear gel and completely scent free. It lathers up so nicely. I added pictures of my loofah and back scrubber lathered up with the wash so potential buyers can see how well it does suds up. I've been using this for about 2 weeks and it is helping with my bumpy skin. There are less and more scattered than before starting this body wash. I use this specifically for my bumpy skin area and use my normal soap for rest of my body (as this is a little more costly and wasteful to use it on parts that are already smooth and bump free. That will make this bottle last longer. Idk if it is much more effective than other washes specifically designed to treat the same thing but it works. I do love that it is scent free, clear from dyes or harsh chemicals and made by a brand that knows skincare. Plus cerave products are formulated to not harm skin barrier and that's important to me. I recommend trying this if you have skin problems. Sign up for subscribe and save to get an intitial discount if promotion is still going on. If you aren't excited about the price, try a less expensive product with same active ingredients because it should work the same. You might not get the same gentle wash though.

But mine is the legit Eucerin, which contrary to the other review, is still produced with the same bottle and packaging as it has been. It says made in Mexico, but again, it’s legit Eucerin. It’s virtually fragrance free, but I have an overly keen sense of smell, so there is a very light suntan-lotiony smell—tho most won’t be able to notice it though and the lotion itself is white (see pic). I tried it on my hand and left it for several hours to be sure it was the real deal, and it is! No rash, no burning, no stinging. I’d say one can order with confidence and if it comes smelling strong or is yellow-tinted, return it because it’s a fake.

1078,1078,B00ECQCVK0,"Sake High Moisture Skin Lotion Toner By Kikumasamune for Women 16.9 Oz Lotion, 16.9 Ounce","UPDATE: I’ve been using this for 2 months now & LOVE ❤️ IT!!! My skin drinks it up & I definitely feel a difference now when I don’t use it. I wasn’t prepared to love it quite as much as I do, & really just wanted to try this prior to trying a different well known Asian Beauty toner, one that has Hyaluronic Acid, but now I don’t think I’ll be trying the other one. I like this one too much to be without it. And that’s huge since I always seem to be on the lookout for the next best thing. I feel like I found it in this product. And I do think it’s helping with skin brightness, although I use lots of brightening skincare products and therefore it’s difficult to know for sure which is responsible for how good it looks right now. I just know I was fighting a purge from a salicylic acid product & you can barely see I ever broke out at all. The red spots have lightened dramatically in just a month (& it was BAD).ORIGINAL REVIEW: I’ve been using this for 10 days & so far I like it. I can’t say I love it, because I don’t see a huge difference yet. Truth be told, I must’ve already had moisturized skin, because I haven’t even seen a change in that.However, I’m happy to not have any negative side effects either. I thought for sure I’d show signs of fungal acne, but so far I’ve avoided that. I do think this is a great carrier for essential oils I recently started using on my face. Just a drop or two of tea tree oil helps acne, or a drop or two of lavender, frankincense, or Rose Otto has allowed my face to gain those added benefits. And I DO see a difference from those when mixed in with this.Also, I don’t have a problem at all with the pump mechanism. It arrived tightly wrapped so it was safe during transit. And it’s held up just fine for my use, so that’s certainly positive.I intend to continue using this for as long as I see no negative effects. But at this point, I’m not sure I’d repurchase it. I have to see if my skin becomes brighter or more supple over time before deciding.",5.0 out of 5 stars,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61taF3SLvNL.jpg,normal,normal_B00ECQCVK0_pid1078_0,https://www.amazon.com/CeraVe-Moisturizing-Lotion-Hyaluronic-Fragrance/dp/B07RK4HST7/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=B07RK4HST7&qid=1592511881&sr=8-1,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51YT4dO6bfL._SL1000_.jpg

I ended up loving it more than the hada labo lotion! It’s a great price for what you get. The bottle is huge! In the picture you can see it’s a large bottle.  I’ve already bought another bottle because I want to use it as a toner for my body. It’s not heavy or sticky at all. There is a slight sake smell that goes away almost immediately after you put it on. I put on usually 5-7 layers since it drys fairly quick.

However - something is seriously wrong with the last two bottles I have received from amazon. I saw a couple of other similar reviews. The consistency is all wrong (been using this product for several years so I can tell) AND the worst part of all is it smells strange! The replacement bottle wasn’t quite as bad smelling as the first which was unbearable but still bad enough that I want to return. Smells musty/plasticy/old if I had to try to name the smell. Consistency is kinda runny and the tint/lotion seems runny and separated.  Seems to still be protecting me from UV but putting it on is probably one of the more unpleasant parts of my day.

I thought I had gotten the wrong product until I check around online.I have combo skin: lightly oily in t-zone but dry everywhere else on the face - which is why I needed this.My skin is sensitive to anything harsh and it has not reacted badly to this.I would suggest doing a spot test by applying to a small area for a week or two before using all over.  I also suggest making sure to wear a good sunscreen while using this and going out into the daylight.I like the applicator tip because it allows me to dispense the product in small increments.The way I use this is to moisten my face so that it's a bit damp & then applying this by patting small dots of it around the dry areas of my face. I let this dry and then I apply my regular moisturizer.Someone once suggested to always apply face serums & moisturizers in the order of thinnest  to thickest.I also find that using my fingers to apply by lightly pat or tap the face treatments help them absorb better.

Oz,"Cerave is one of the VC products affordable to me as I am a graduate student living paycheck by paycheck. I bought it a month ago. It is not harmful to me and also improves my skin.First of all, it does not cause any side reaction on my face (I did do a patch test before applying to the whole face though). I guess 10% is on the lower end. I use my fingertips to massage it on my face. It absorbs really fast and also moisturizes my skin.I also noticed my skin tone become a bit more even, not very much though. My skin is still yellow, which becomes brighter and firmer. Especially the T zone is less oily.Well I don’t know if it is really the vitamin c in it or the hydronic acid that is working. But it is at least not harmful.That said, I do have one complaint.I really like the airtight tube and the cream inside it has not discolored so far. But the serum does change a little once you squeeze it out. You can see from my pic that the edge of the cream becomes orange, different from the original white to yellow, indicating the oxidation of vitamin C (it is within half a minute after I pump it out). It is even more so if my palm is wet.  I know vitamin c is very reductive, which is exactly the reason it can be an anti-oxidant. But I did not know it gets oxidized so easily.  Even though the part oxidized is small and I don’t know about other brands, I still hope this formula may be improved.Overall,  I will make a second purchase to see the effect in the long run and will definitely keep vitamin c in my skincare routine.",5.0 out of 5 stars,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71injdGHD-L.jpg,normal,normal_B07PNCCLD2_pid1161_0,https://www.amazon.com/CeraVe-Moisturizing-Lotion-Hyaluronic-Fragrance/dp/B07RK4HST7/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=B07RK4HST7&qid=1592511881&sr=8-1,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51YT4dO6bfL._SL1000_.jpg

The one big disadvantage I do not like about this lotion is it does contain “petroleum” which I try to avoid.  Your skin is your biggest organ that you have and the whole point of this lotion is to absorb into your skin. I prefer more natural and healthier moisturizer ingredients to put on and into my body. Personal preference. I also had pump issues as one of the other reviewers also stated that the top pump was really hard to get open.

After three days of using this cream over all the legs I felt an itch on parts of my legs that I never felt before, and parts under the treatment of this cream. After three days I feel my skin irritated, after maybe five days is itchy, and after the week is just... You can see the photos. These are part my legs right now. So, I have a new itch and more red skin. Maybe the cream is good for the treatment of the itch of the eczema and the relieve of that itch is for hours. But, after using this continously, after days, you should be careful because the skin can be irritated and with a new itch.

The CeraVe Cream worked for me.  Shortly after receipt we applied a small amount to the area on my back with an itch.  Shortly i had relief.  Manufacturer claims based on testing with 34 people the itch was gone within two minutes.  I did not time this.  The manufacturer also claims eight (8) hour relief.  It did not last that long for me.  After a shower a larger amount will be applied and that may be the key.  Update..... It took about thirty minutes for the itch to stop.  Four hours later some of the affected areas did start to itch again.  Still i consider that success.Recommended = Four Star ⭐️  Thank-you for looking at my review.

Pramoxine hydrochloride is a topical anesthetic and CeraVe is a thick cream which is easy to apply.There are a number of inactive ingredients.  I was struck by the disclosure that there was a clinical test involving 34 patients.  While that is a small study, it is admirable that it is listed right on the label since most products are not as transparent as to whether there even were any studies.  There have been many studies worldwide on the active ingredient that can be found on a search so the 34 patient clinical study must be for this particular combination of active and inactive ingredients. Looking at the list of inactive ingredients, most of the leading ingredients are similar to that found in many moisturizing creams.Anyone who suffers from notalgia paresthetica or acute dermatitis can well understand that chronic intense itching can reduce one’s quality of life.  Having a product that can help alleviate the itch is a necessity.CeraVe Moisturizing Cream for Itch Relief worked very quickly to help calm the itching of my notalgia paresthetica.

They should call it the magic winter cream. My skin gets so dried, cracked, and itchy in the winter. A little bit of this takes that all away! I like how big the container is, how moisturizing it is, and how it makes the itch go away. There's some sort of scent to it. I can't tell if it's a medicated type scent or how to describe it. It's not overwhelming and goes away pretty quickly after you use it. The biggest thing I don't like is that it's a little greasy. You really have to rub it in and then kind of wait for it to dry.

I have gotten a sample from my dermatologist and I have also purchased my own from my local pharmacy. This product should be a liquidy white consistency. And I mean it should be very very white. It also has a particular smell like medicine. The texture of it on your skin is also very particular. What Amazon sold to me is yellow and thick and texture and has no smell at all. It doesn’t feel the way it should on the skin. This is just very wrong. I have a chronic skin disease and I cannot use this unknown product on my skin for fear of what it may do.
