It's mild and lovely.As for it's moisturizing property,it's working nicely on my dry skin. My skin feels and looks lot better now. But the real litmus test will be in winter,when my very dry skin will tell how good this really is!The ingredients in this lotion includes Tapioca starch; the ingredient used in moisturizers that gives it's non greasy effect. So this lotion really does have a non greasy feeling.I bought this for a deal price of Rs.211. well worth it.Shelf life also very good,expiring in 2021.But I'm giving 4 stars as my initial impression was not good because I received a broken pump,I didn't find the broken part in the package which means it was packed broken and not a transit damage.",4.0 out of 5 stars,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61GYLgvxsOL.jpg

166,166,B000ORWKY8,"Veet In-shower Hair Removal Cream, Normal Skin - 150 ml","I think it's a good new launch for all Veet lovers because it is easy for application while ur taking bath. 1st apply some cream in the skin, pink side sponge is to apply cream, then if u want u can start to take shower/bath in the next 1min, then in the next 3 or 4mins take the white side of the sponge given and rub it clock or anticlockwise to remove the cream along with hair until it vanishes. Total time for the cream should not exceed more than 5 or 6mins.Pros:Easy to use.It's also a cream to apply even while shower.Sponge technique is quite easy.Skin friendly.Cons:Though sponge is a easy one, the white sponge is really rough while removing the cream, so caution part is do not wipe sponge again & again in same spot.Have attached the pics in all directions since its a new launch.. Did the testing in a small portion in hand and attached the pic too, 1 pic is with hairs and the other is without, really it gives a very smooth skin than the usual Veet.

The quantity of the cream is good and a sponge along with it is a cherry on cake.This one has a different concept, I apply this cream before showering and application is done with the soft colored side of the sponge and then after waiting for 3 minutes approximately I wash it off by scrubbing it in circular motion (in flowing water or while taking shower) by the other side of the sponge and it takes away all the hair that were ever on the skin.

The tub is going to last at least 4-5 months if you apply it on the face only, and it‚Äôs really thick. The tub has a black cap and an additional washer fit in the cap.Packaging-The package arrived safe and sound, all wrapped up in a cardboard box. The individual units were heat sealed with plastic, which discards any chances of leakage (and the fear that most of us have, someone else using a bit and then sending it to us). The bottle is transparent and I always prefer it that way, as you can know how much of the moisturizing cream you have used and how much is left, before ordering for a refill.Constituent-It has a great number of oils like, shea butter, camelina sativa seed oil, canola oil, melanin, glycerine etc.Product quality-I am absolutely in love with this cream. It has everything you need for a well moisturized skin and the best part is, it blends really well. You can mix your daily foundation or lightening serum in this cream and apply it, or apply them  after applying this first. I use a matte foundation so this cream added a certain shine and glow to it. The cream is really thick, fluffy and creamy and the moisturization lasts for really long hours. At minimum its going to last for 3-4 hours. The moisturizing power of this cream is really remarkable and is great if you spent long hours in air conditioned rooms. Air conditioned rooms make our skin feel rather dry and sometimes it flakes as well. I am a library person spend at least 3-4 hours in a day, so it has really helped me, as our library is air conditioned. This cream can also be used if you don‚Äôt have AC, just dab a bit of baby powder after applying it, the powder absorbs the extra oils and the stuff required for the skin, stays in. And it‚Äôs a big tub, so its probably gonna last more than a year, as I have combination type of skin.Results-I have been using it almost regularly (except the days I am in a hurry), and I love the results, I have already recommended to a friend who has a 9-5 job and she is loving it as well.Price- The price is manageable for the cream as the tub is huge and would last for months. Also buying from amazon would be a great choice as I used a coupon they had and also there is extra discount if you subscribe for it",5.0 out of 5 stars,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71S7S2uiJ-L.jpg,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71h8rWuTvDL.jpg"

So I was looking for a heavy duty night cream that wasn't great or light, and this product caught my eyes frankly because of the name!! And it delivers on what it promises. I use it as night cream as part of my Ctm routine and don't wake up with a face that feels like Sahara desert.The cream is white in color and thick to touch but melts on the face and does not feel greasy at all. The main ingredients are shea butter, sativa oil along with chemical oil. It is not all natural ingredients product, but it does not have any harmful chemical. The smell is very mild and reminded me of vanishing cream my mom used to use when I was a kid.So a definite yes for this cream if you have very dry skin like me, and since it clearly says it is for dry skin, those with oily skin can give it a miss.

505,505,B076D51Y9P,"Happily Unmarried AC Moisturizing Cream, 100gm (Dry to Normal Skin)","Original rating-3.5/5Skin type while using it: Oily, always prone to acne and dehydrationI'll start with the only problem I've with this product- strong scent. Normally, my skin can get along with perfumed skin care products but it just doesn't react well to this cream. I'm guessing that's because the scent is pretty strong. It lingers on my face even after 20-25 minutes of using it.After a week of using it, I noticed small bumps forming on my forehead and jaw line area. This is why I stopped using it. Pity because it does an amazing job at moisturizing skin without leaving any greasy feel behind.The texture of this product is more of a gel-cream which makes for a light consistency. It blends easily and gets absorbed completely rather than just sitting on top of the skin. I apply it on my damp skin for better absorption. Even my makeup goes on much better with my skin adequately moisturized.If you're okay with strong fragrances in your skincare, give it a try. A little bit goes a long way to keep skin supple without that yucky oily feeling.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ToPD2DxNL.jpg,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71fhZ2axfYL.jpg,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71gf0ofQWEL.jpg,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71hfQpU2h0L.jpg,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71lVFOCytwL.jpg"

603,603,B016ZA76QO,ST. D'VENCE Winter Edition Body Lotion with Tea Tree Oil and Shea Butter for Dry Skin,"HI THEREI have a sensitive & a bit dry skin so very choosy in buying any beauty product.I have been using ST DVENCI winter edition moisturiser for the past several months now.I'm going to share my experience & personal  views on this product &of course that might vary from one customer to the other .BOTTLE PACKAGINGBottle looks neat & attractive with a pump.But, as many customers pointed out the last 40 ml of cream is below the pump & getting it out is nuisance & irritating.WHAT'S INSIDE THE BOTTLETea tree ,jojoba & vitamin E oill ,shea butter,  alovera are some of the main ingredients.The cream is thick, creamy and spreads real quick on the skin.No sticky / oily feel.The fragrance is extremely pleasant.WHEN TO USE?Ideally after bath when our skin is still moistIS IT EFFECTIVE?Personally for me very effective. My skin looks soft, supple & thoroughly hydrated. It nourishes my skin from deep inside.Real quality product.Many reviewers have written how this is ideal for winter & for dry skinned people.According to me this moisturiser is also extremely suitable for MATURE SKIN (above 38+) I'm 40+ & by far this is the ideal cream I have ever come across.ANY NEGATIVES?Apart from the pump that doesn't allow the last 40 mls of cream out,none.FINAL WORDThick ,fragrant cream. Easy to use.My skin simply responded very well to this product.One can feel how well it nourishes the skin with in 3 to 4 days of usage.300 ml botte lasts approximately 45 to 50 days .(moderate use)Would I recommend this if you are interested in buying? Most certainly yes! Would I buy again? Yep.In fact i have already purchased 3 bottles.REVIEW UPDATE ON 24.02.2020My fourth bottle has a pump that's lengthier than the previous ones. Now, the cream can be pumped almost fully. I would like to give full credit to the manufacturers for listening to the consumer's feedback, act & increase the length of the pump. A simple but very effective improvement. Well Done!One more thing-  this cream is no longer for very dry skin people but for dry skin. The difference is now, it doesn't give long hours of moisturizing effect like before.HOPE THIS REVIEW IS USEFUL TO YOU",5.0 out of 5 stars,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/617NBGv3M4L.jpg,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61DQFCEgwPL.jpg,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61o9vMtkD0L.jpg"

It really is useful and odour and sweatproof but also depends on your activities. I use it regularly after taking a bath, you should apply it after taking a bath and let it dry for 5 minutes and then change into your clothes, after drying if you touch it, it gives a sticky feeling to your fingers and it leaves a white residue which I guess is the anti-presipitant thing which makes us sweatproof, it also sticks to your clothes where your under arms touch but I don't mind because it gets washed off easily and isn't really a problem, I really love this product, it is really nice and I'll definitely buy it again but if you sweat way too much and if you play sports I don't think it will be very useful to you but still you can try it. One more thing, I don't know if it whitens your underarms or not but if definitely won't blacken them, I was really afraid about it earlier but I am very happy that it doesn't blacken the underarms.

845,845,B07LFBXW8F,Mamaearth Skin Repair Natural Winter Body Lotion with Mango & Kokum butter for Women & Men with Extra Dry Skin,Knock knock!!! Winter is approaching  &  I need the best moisturiser for my skin. What to do :-). Actually I am always reacting like that whenever the season changes and time to choose some skin care. My skin is very sensitive so I always do prefer finding something pure and less chemical inside. For a moment chemicals may give you the expected result and make your skin brighter but eventually it deliberately reduses the immunity power of your skin. So finding the good moisturiser for winter care is not an easy task in all terms especially for me. That literally makes me so confused because a lot of famous brands with lots of commitments with guarantee ' lol..When I choose this Mamaearth winter care lotion I was slightly hesitant and trust me it is so amazin. The best part of it which I found i.e. it does not make your skin greecey. Despite making my skin very soft & glow in this cold it feels very lighter and it's fragrance is also too good. Overall I am loving it! Thank you for reading my review :-) Bye!*Please click the Helpful button if you like this review.

I was using Earth Therapy night cream before (I was satisfied with its results) and from the first days itself I have observed Alpha Choice has poor results (but it cost 100 Rs more than my first night cream). Still I was patient enough to wait for a its effect on my skin. But after almost three weeks after purchase I have noticed some odd-looking grey stuff in the corner of the top layer and some change in the consistency as well. I have ignored it thinking that it can be natural and continued with the usage. But day-by-day it was growing and realised that it's a colony of bacteria or fungi and stopped using. With in that time I have developed break outs on my face as well. I have write to the seller regarding the issue through the option on amazon but they have not responded yet.

873,873,B06WVQS84F,"WOW Anti Aging No Parabens & Mineral Oil Night Cream, 50mL","First of all, if you think that this or any other anti wrinkle/anti aging cream etc. Is going to get rid of your existing wrinkles then I don't think that is going to happen, no matter how much expensive the product is. These creams can only 'visibly' reduce wrinkles by keeping skin moisturized and that can delay new wrinkles development.Even Biotique wheat germ night cream could do the same at less than 200/-. Its only problem is that it is too oily and can't be used in hot weather.Now about this WOW cream, first time I got this cream from WOW directly. I have finished that cream. It was properly packed but I don't remember if it had any sealing or wrapper ouside. It lasted around 2 months. It is not greasy or sticky at all and is a bit dry so it is good for both summers and winters. I have used it in winters without any issue of any kind. It has mild fragrance which I liked. After applying it you don't feel that you have applied anything on you face. It does seem to work a little on wrinkles as long as you are using it. The so called air tight jar's dispenser works bit erratically and it does not work when around 1/3rd of the cream is left. So you have to open it to use the cream. Overall I was okay with the cream but because of the price I would give it 3 stars.Few days ago (Jan, 2019) it was on sale and I ordered 2 of these from Amazon. When I received both, boxes had scratches and jars were packed in open boxes without any kind of seal either inside or outside. Quantity seemed less but I might be wrong so I have attached few images to show what was inside when I received those.I am giving it 1 star for no sealing at all and for high MRP.You can buy it if you are getting it for around Rs 450. That is the price for which Ponds Age Miracle night cream, which I am using these days, sells for on Amazon and is similar.Update May 10th, 2019 - I oredered the cream once again. Just received it. It was manufactured in March, 2019. There is no improvement in packing at all. Open box and unsealed jar. They don't listen to customer feedback.

As it gets absorbed your body is very relaxed and remains moisturized for longer period of time. Must recommend.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61os-0TaPXL.jpg,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61q-LjIQXeL.jpg"

It also keeps you fresh all day and increases your work capacity.Oily creams and moisturisers may be unacceptable to some and may cause breakouts in some others. I have acne problem and so I remain very careful in what I apply on my skin.While searching for a good skin care routine product, I came across this aloe gel formula from Indus Valley. I ordered it because the packaging was vintage ( I love vintagggeeee).The biggest advantages about this product:* easy to incorporate in your day to day skin care. If you have to apply the original aloe from the leaves, it will take some time to cut, wash, peel the leaves. It might not be the best idea for your busy schedule.* It is not oily at all* Made from natural product. Does not contain any chemicals or toxic substances* Has a very nice aroma.I am presenting to you some of the ways, I love to use aloe gel in my day to day routine. Hope you like it too.Aloe gel has Vitamin E which acts as an antioxidant and a natural nutrient for your skin.* Over the night moisturiser: Apply a teaspoonful of gel on your face and massage thoroughly. Leave it overnight to get a soft skin in the morning.* Morning moisturiser: After washing your face, use aloe gel to soothe your skin and before going out. This protects the delicate skin from the harsh sunrays, pollution and dry air.* Body lotion: You can use it to apply on your hands and legs in general as a good moisturiser.* Hair mask: Mix it with a little amount of curd and prepare a paste. Apply it on your hair from roots to tips. Leave it for 1 hour and then wash it usually. This conditions and strengthens your hair. Alternately you can also apply the raw aloe gel to avail the same benefits. Do this once every 2 weeks.So these are some of the ways, I like to use Aloe gel in my routine. If you guys have some novel ways, do let me know. I would love to try that.And thats the end of it! Hope you enjoyed it!

1340,1340,B079SPTSP4,"Lakme Blush & Glow Facewash, Lemon Fresh, 100g","Lakme has always been my go to brand from the very beginning. Tried the new Lakme Blush & Glow lemon fresh face wash. As the name suggests, the fragrance is very citrus-y, menthol-y and attention grabbing. The face wash doesn't lather much but gives a nice coverage on the face and neck. As lemon is considered to get rid of dirt and grime, the face wash indeed gets the oil and dirt off your skin. However, you will have to immediately apply a moisturizer as the skin gets very dry. If allergic to certain specific salts such as sodium/ sulphates etc then please read the label before making your purchase.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71jjB4pJCKL.jpg,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81jd3b0pUrL.jpg"
