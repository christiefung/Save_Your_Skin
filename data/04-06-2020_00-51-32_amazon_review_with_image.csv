I did a lot of research before buying this..as it is non comodogenic so it wont clog your pores and cause breakouts..this sunscreen leaves a terrible white cast on..you'll have to spend a great amt of time rubbing and tugging your  skin to spread it all over skin  ..hello early signs of ageing !!!  ...which  is something you literally are trying to avoid when getting a sunscreen..im dusky skinned..and it leaves a terrible white cast on..and if you're fair skinned and you think it would'nt matter..here's another drawback..the cream literally starts forming rubbery particles as you try to layer it around your face.....{like the dead skin that comes of your skin..except its white ..} so as much as you try to apply this around it will flake off...c'mon ponds like can you have one average product..just one????.and another thing is  is how small it is..they should mention that the product is sample size as its just way too small,2.0 out of 5 stars,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/713La9U36kL.jpg,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71xO2eftKXL.jpg"

It's light and non-greasy and gets absorbed within a few seconds. It as a strong chocolate fragrance and while applying everybody in the house will know about it due to the strong scent. The fragrance is more like liquid dairy milk chocolate.If you have extreme dry skin, please go for Vaseline Intensive care Advanced Reapair (white bottle) lotion or Nivea body milk (navy blue bottle) which is meant to repair extreme dry skin. Oh!! Doesn't matter how many body lotion i use, this will stand out all of them.Maybe the main reason it's delicious scent.

So, thumbs up for this packaging.And at end of review, i would thank amazon for good packaging and delivery.",5.0 out of 5 stars,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71fPCvS0v9L.jpg

You can purchase this product from @amazondotinI have an oily skin and this moisturiser is meant for oily skin as it claims to give you an oil free and mattifying finish. So here is my review. This product is priced at ‚Çπ599 for 100ml of the product. I find it a little pricey, And not an affordable moisturiser. It has a shelf life of 2 years and is pretty decent. It does not have any sort of noticeable fragrance. It is formulated without any harmful chemicals. The packaging is sturdy and travel friendly. The texture is nor too thick nor too runny. Now coming to my experience, it is a good moisturiser and keeps your skin moisturised really well. As it is winters my skin still feels a bit oily. This moisturiser did not give me any mattifying finish. Nor it is oil free. It makes my skin feel really moisturised and does add a glow and shine to the skin. After 2-3 hours my skin feels too much moisturised, hydrated, oily and glowy that I need to use a blotting paper. I have tried and tested this product for more than 12 days. It is a good moisturiser. But when looking at the claims that it is for oily skin & gives no shine; So then this does not do what is claims. If I ignore the claims then this moisturiser is good for all skin types, but if I consider the ‚Äúoily skin part‚Äù it is definitely not for oily skinned people.

458,458,B07YHZRHGW,"NIVEA Hand Cream, Soothing Glycerin & Olive, 75ml","I am a hand cream hoarder and i have tried hand creams from every price range and I can safely add this one to my top 5 handcreams. Just to tell you a bit about my preference in creams, I have sweaty palms and when I apply handcreams it gets a lot worse, so I look for crems that are hydrating and non greas. Due to a lot of hand washing my hands feel very dry and I go over hand creams like water. So I was looking for a affordable and better quality hand cream and thought of ordering this one. This hand cream has a perfect consistency it's not too runny and not too thick either. Comes in a tube packaging which I prefer because that very hygiene. It has mild but pleasent fragrance that lingers for hours and it's not too overpowering for fragrance sensitive people. The cream gets absorbed into your hands quickly and you need just a bit of it. If you have extremely dry hands you might need bit more than usual quantity as its very light cream for that matter. You get 75 ml of crems for 90 rupees which is a very great price for the quantity and compared to other brands its very very reasonable. This lasts me a month or so with all my excessive washing but it depends on your personal usage totally. Its manufactured in Germany. You can look at ingredients list in the pics I've attached.Overall i'd repurchase this product again for sure.

It also keeps you fresh all day and increases your work capacity.Oily creams and moisturisers may be unacceptable to some and may cause breakouts in some others. I have acne problem and so I remain very careful in what I apply on my skin.While searching for a good skin care routine product, I came across this aloe gel formula from Indus Valley. I ordered it because the packaging was vintage ( I love vintagggeeee).The biggest advantages about this product:* easy to incorporate in your day to day skin care. If you have to apply the original aloe from the leaves, it will take some time to cut, wash, peel the leaves. It might not be the best idea for your busy schedule.* It is not oily at all* Made from natural product. Does not contain any chemicals or toxic substances* Has a very nice aroma.I am presenting to you some of the ways, I love to use aloe gel in my day to day routine. Hope you like it too.Aloe gel has Vitamin E which acts as an antioxidant and a natural nutrient for your skin.* Over the night moisturiser: Apply a teaspoonful of gel on your face and massage thoroughly. Leave it overnight to get a soft skin in the morning.* Morning moisturiser: After washing your face, use aloe gel to soothe your skin and before going out. This protects the delicate skin from the harsh sunrays, pollution and dry air.* Body lotion: You can use it to apply on your hands and legs in general as a good moisturiser.* Hair mask: Mix it with a little amount of curd and prepare a paste. Apply it on your hair from roots to tips. Leave it for 1 hour and then wash it usually. This conditions and strengthens your hair. Alternately you can also apply the raw aloe gel to avail the same benefits. Do this once every 2 weeks.So these are some of the ways, I like to use Aloe gel in my routine. If you guys have some novel ways, do let me know. I would love to try that.And thats the end of it! Hope you enjoyed it!

And quite frankly I wasn't hoping for much because of the cost and my other failures with biotque and other skin products.I bought this in November , as it was getting very cold and my skin was becoming drier everyday and rough. So decided to use this night cream.I have oily to normal combination skin and prone to acne. So was skeptical about this product as not very many skin products suit me.So I'm writing this review after using the product for a good two months . I've used it almost every night.  It's really good. Like the formulation is very light and keeps the skin hydrated. And in the morning the skin feels extremely soft. You just need a small amount and even after using it for 2 months  almost everyday, more than half is remaining. I'm quite happy with the product. And I'll reuse it obviously.

787,787,B07LFBXW8F,Mamaearth Skin Repair Natural Winter Body Lotion with Mango & Kokum butter for Women & Men with Extra Dry Skin,Knock knock!!! Winter is approaching  &  I need the best moisturiser for my skin. What to do :-). Actually I am always reacting like that whenever the season changes and time to choose some skin care. My skin is very sensitive so I always do prefer finding something pure and less chemical inside. For a moment chemicals may give you the expected result and make your skin brighter but eventually it deliberately reduses the immunity power of your skin. So finding the good moisturiser for winter care is not an easy task in all terms especially for me. That literally makes me so confused because a lot of famous brands with lots of commitments with guarantee ' lol..When I choose this Mamaearth winter care lotion I was slightly hesitant and trust me it is so amazin. The best part of it which I found i.e. it does not make your skin greecey. Despite making my skin very soft & glow in this cold it feels very lighter and it's fragrance is also too good. Overall I am loving it! Thank you for reading my review :-) Bye!*Please click the Helpful button if you like this review.

If you are a fan of¬†Berry Blossom, then you will love it. The fragrance is not very sweet like girly ones, and hence, would suit a woman perfectly. The lotion contains extracts of Berry Blossom and¬†Jojoba Oil¬†and also lots of other essential oils. The list of ingredients looks pretty impressive. My skin is quite dry and sensitive but it tends not to get dry during summers. Hence, this lotion is sufficient for my normally dry skin. I apply it only once and the skin feels reliven. Overall, I am satisfied with this product and the results are pretty good.""",5.0 out of 5 stars,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71-6FlfUN4L.jpg
962,962,B07PHTMMVP,"NIVEA Soft, Light Moisturising Cream, Berry Blossom, 100ml","It has been a week since I‚Äôve been using the Nivea Berry Blossom moisturizer and I am pleasantly surprised. Initially, I thought the product was going to be greasy and was meant to be used during the harsh winters but that is not the case. The Nivea Berry Blossom moisturizer is made with Vitamin E and Jojoba oil which makes it super light and non-greasy. The berry extracts give it a pleasant smell and leave the skin feeling fresh for quite a long time. It is especially good for people on the go who do not devote much time to their skincare. This does not take much time to apply. Only a small coin sized amount of this product goes a long way. It is quick absorbing and has a light texture. It does not melt off the face during the heat which makes it perfect for the summers. Unlike the other thousands of moisturizers available in the market today this one is suitable for all skin types to be it oily or dry. After using it for a week I can tell the difference in my skin already. My skin has gotten softer, smoother and much brighter. I feel fresh. As far as makeup is concerned I feel like this would act as a perfect base or primer for any makeup look. Because of its light and non-greasy texture, any kind of foundation can be applied to it without having to fear that it is going to melt or clump up with the foundation. For the many benefits that this product is presenting us with the price is very affordable. 100ml for only Rs 160 is a bargain. Everyone can finally afford great skin without having to think about the dent that‚Äôs going occur in their pockets.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71CqKNOj2ZL.jpg,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Y4u2ixUoL.jpg"

After using Nivea Berry Blossom Moisturizer, my skin was super soft and had that bounce back again.I've been using it for a long time now and it always gives me a kind of satisfaction. It contains essential oils and vitamins that keep the skin hydrated and locks the moisture in. It is super compact and can fit in your travel pouch so you can carry it anywhere easily.You can also use it before applying makeup as when you are using a matte foundation or lipstick your skin dries up too fast and to avoid those cracks this is the best thing to apply before applying makeup.

It REALLY gives you even skin tone after application, and lightens the dark spots. It gives UV protection too.

It doesn't feel sticky when you apply and leaves skin feeling smooth. I have been using this particular gel for about a week, and it's been great. I even use it on my face - this is sort of the ultimate test for any skincare product, because I have stupidly sensitive facial skin. The gel leaves it soft and even sort of soothes it.I give this five stars because it does everything it says it will - and it's actual aloe vera gel, not some clear gunk that's been dressed up with artificial colors and scents.

The manufacturer should market this product at least with a 50 Gram tube.DOSAGE:Apply twice daily for at least 6 - 8 Weeks.I would strongly recommend this product to my fellow shoppers.

On a serious note, did feel like returning it but these things are expected when it comes to products that are manufactured in cottage industries I guess. Promptly took the hair strand out and been using it for about 10 days now. It's extremely thick and rich, one needs to scrape it out as it solidifies at room temperature leading to a grainy texture. But once you take it on the palm and rub it, it melts without any effort making it easier to apply. I would probably not use it in the day as it is very rich, kinda oily and may get on clothes as it doesn't get absorbed completely (mind you, I've extremely dry skin). The scent is pretty mild and raw, nothing nasty. People who're used to synthetic/ processed scents might dislike this. Good news is, no more chemicals go on your skin which is the largest organ in your body. So, I made my own body butter at home following a DIY recipe and I loved the result.

Now, it is just kept aside in the washroom, and probably will lie there for a year, before being thrown away.I believe, there are quite a few companies, which are producing cheap, worthless products and selling them on Amazon.

As per the name instant fairness cream, gives instant glow after applying it. It makes a thin white layer on face after applying it and face looks bright.If used regularly, over the period of time this cream helps to reduce dark spots and makes skin fair. It claims to get the natural glow, but I didn't find glow on my face. I have fair skin and thus needs very less quantity of cream as I look whitish after using more quantity of cream. But I'm sure this cream will be perfect for people with darker skin tone. One more feature about the product is, it comes in travel-friendly packaging so it can be used while traveling as well.

1644,1644,B016ZA76QO,ST. D'VENCE Winter Edition Body Lotion with Tea Tree Oil and Shea Butter for Dry Skin,"HI THEREI have a sensitive & a bit dry skin so very choosy in buying any beauty product.I have been using ST DVENCI winter edition moisturiser for the past several months now.I'm going to share my experience & personal  views on this product &of course that might vary from one customer to the other .BOTTLE PACKAGINGBottle looks neat & attractive with a pump.But, as many customers pointed out the last 40 ml of cream is below the pump & getting it out is nuisance & irritating.WHAT'S INSIDE THE BOTTLETea tree ,jojoba & vitamin E oill ,shea butter,  alovera are some of the main ingredients.The cream is thick, creamy and spreads real quick on the skin.No sticky / oily feel.The fragrance is extremely pleasant.WHEN TO USE?Ideally after bath when our skin is still moistIS IT EFFECTIVE?Personally for me very effective. My skin looks soft, supple & thoroughly hydrated. It nourishes my skin from deep inside.Real quality product.Many reviewers have written how this is ideal for winter & for dry skinned people.According to me this moisturiser is also extremely suitable for MATURE SKIN (above 38+) I'm 40+ & by far this is the ideal cream I have ever come across.ANY NEGATIVES?Apart from the pump that doesn't allow the last 40 mls of cream out,none.FINAL WORDThick ,fragrant cream. Easy to use.My skin simply responded very well to this product.One can feel how well it nourishes the skin with in 3 to 4 days of usage.300 ml botte lasts approximately 45 to 50 days .(moderate use)Would I recommend this if you are interested in buying? Most certainly yes! Would I buy again? Yep.In fact i have already purchased 3 bottles.REVIEW UPDATE ON 24.02.2020My fourth bottle has a pump that's lengthier than the previous ones. Now, the cream can be pumped almost fully. I would like to give full credit to the manufacturers for listening to the consumer's feedback, act & increase the length of the pump. A simple but very effective improvement. Well Done!One more thing-  this cream is no longer for very dry skin people but for dry skin. The difference is now, it doesn't give long hours of moisturizing effect like before.HOPE THIS REVIEW IS USEFUL TO YOU",5.0 out of 5 stars,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/617NBGv3M4L.jpg,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61DQFCEgwPL.jpg,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61o9vMtkD0L.jpg"

I have tried so many different products to combat these problems and I always end up back at the dove. I love the soap bar because you get so much product for such a small price. They last ages and are easy to travel with.I never get a tight feeling after washing my body with this and I find it holds moisture better than other moisturizing body washes.As far as bar cleansers go, the Dove Beauty Cream Bar is the holy grail, a classic product that I have returned to over and over again throughout my life. The Dove Beauty Cream Bar is a great option for those with sensitive or dry skin. I have very dry eczema prone skin and this is always my go-to bar cleanser. I love the smell and texture and it always leaves my skin feeling clean, fresh and soft. For something so moisturising it lathers very well and doesn't leave any nasty residue on the skin. On the downside there are more moisturising products out there which may be necessary for those with super dry skin like me, the Dove Triple Moisturising Body Wash is actually a great option for those that need that little bit extra.---------PROS:---------- It's Dove.- It works wonders on sensitive skin.- It's cheaper on Amazon than from retail stores.---------CONS:---------- None that I can think of.__________________tl;dr: It's the soap you use when everything else doesn't work.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61WGxoLBUcL.jpg,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/710KQWqvZCL.jpg,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71AwL9EF5AL.jpg,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71GwW7OwHYL.jpg,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71cbgaVvmGL.jpg,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71f6n2rmVtL.jpg,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71olJ9ONIvL.jpg,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/814HaDMeewL.jpg,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81JDgxscjmL.jpg,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81wq+g6w4pL.jpg"

2141,2141,B07NM4TN3Y,RE' EQUIL Pitstop‚Ñ¢ Gel for Acne Scars Removal and Acne Pits Removal - 30g,I saw its advertisement on Instagram and ordered the one. Rcvd the package today itself.  The instructions on the package says to apply it 3-4 times a day and generously. I dnt think this small tube is goin to last even for a week. And to see the results you need to apply atleast for 3-6 months on existing scars. Which comes out to be weWhopping min rs 6000 for min 3 months even when results are not sure.

With proper use, this ointment can repair woeful acne scars and pockmarks (pits) to a significant extent.I bagged this ointment/gel for Rs.590, and it got shipped to my place on time inside a well-sealed box.POSITIVES:‚Ä¢ It repairs the new and old acne scars (raised or pitted) to a satisfactory level. It may take time depending upon the severity and extent of the skin condition, but with regular use, you are most likely to witness positive results.‚Ä¢ It's a non-comedogenic product.‚Ä¢ It contains 'Liftonin¬Æ - Xpert', an essential ingredient that helps in the formation of new collagen fibres to repair pitted acne scars.‚Ä¢ Both men and women can use this gel.‚Ä¢ This product is free from harmful parabens, sulphates, silicones, and mineral oils.NEGATIVES:‚Ä¢ The cost of this product is slightly on the higher side.‚Ä¢ A '30 Gram tube' is going to be emptied within two to three weeks.DOSAGE:Apply it 3 - 4 times a day for at least two months for the new scars, and three to six months for the old ones.I would highly recommend this gel to other shoppers because of its sheer effectiveness.
